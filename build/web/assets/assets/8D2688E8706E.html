Sources say it self that an alert or deffensive driver is the best driver because the driver is aware of traffic. Did google stop an ask if the computers were aware? Probaly not they think that the car is so perfect they probaly didnt stop an think safety.</br></br>Google came up with the idea that when the driver should be prepared to take over the car flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays will appear thats a bad idea I say that because what if the lights appear on the dashboard an the driver begans to take over an soon as the lights go away the driver hits another car or a pedestrian?</br></br>Dr. Werner Huber said "why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"

Thats a good question an I say that because what if the car does get in a accident who can the other person blame? The driver or the car it self?
