Dear Principal,</br></br>Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME.</br></br><span style="color:orange">i am one of the students that goes to your school. I wanted to talk to you about the cell phone policy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think you should go with policy 1.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">We would bring cell phones to school but they would be turned off during class and would be only used on lunch periods or free times.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Some people might not follow that policy but it would sure help out a lot.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">One of the reasons why i would go with policy 1 is that there could be an emergency somewhere in the school and nobody knows about it and you have a cell phone with you, you could call the office or a teacher.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Or when somebody got hurt real bad and they have no information or number for your parent or guardian, but you have a number of their family members or friends, it would really help.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Even though students have their cell phones out during class and in the hallways. There would be an emergency one day and somebody has a cell phone with them, it helps.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
