They also don't always get controll over who they vote for. Say they voted for one canidate to be their state senator, well with that one person comes many people that have "pledged" themselves to that canidate. They would be voting for the canidate and these many people that have pledged themselves to him and they don't even know it.</br></br>Also as they say in source 2, the election of 2000 was a huge mishap in presidential election history. In states like Louisiana, they had people replace democratic electors so that the popular vote that would've went to one of the canidates, didn't actually go through.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01532748294,0.206238924,<span style="color:white">0.7784335899999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Although the electoral college is good for getting exact numbers and helps solve disputes( source 3)</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.0287859444,0.4850122520000001,<span style="color:white">0.486201796</span>]</span> <span style="color:yellow">it is an uruly and untrustworthy way of voting and should not be used anymore.

Even some of our presidents like Richard Nixon and Bob Dole have thought that this was the way to go. Not only do they believe this, but they lost their presidency votes becuase of the electoral college. I think that they are just trying to scam voters and pick someone that would be best for them, not for our country. I think that by using the electoral college method, they are cheating into picking the winners, but if we used popular vote, this wouldnt happen.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.00524996606,0.183575474,<span style="color:white">0.8111745600000001</span>]</span> </br></br>Thank you for your time.
