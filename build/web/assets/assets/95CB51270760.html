<span style="color:orange">Honestly I think they shouldn't change the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.115737464,<span style="color:white">0.8648429719999999</span>,0.0194195742]</span> . I have three reasons why they shouldn't change the Electoral College. <span style="color:orange">This Electoral College has made this nation historical,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0886005946,<span style="color:white">0.8864488139999999</span>,0.0249505957999999]</span> it would be <span style="color:orange">too much work to change it</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.142971182,<span style="color:white">0.8447710500000001</span>,0.0122577726]</span> ,and <span style="color:orange">it wouldn't be the same if they changed it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.166346796,<span style="color:white">0.8189835200000001</span>,0.0146697026]</span> </br></br>Changing this Electoral College wouldn't be the best thing to do cause it's made this nation have so many historical moments. <span style="color:white">We had so many presidents that changed this nation. George Washington was probably the most remembered president. Washington fought for our country in wars that happened long ago. He made this country have so much meaning to it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.61395581</span>,0.382959126,0.0030850414]</span> </br></br>Another reason why they shouldn't change the Electoral College is because it would be too much work. <span style="color:orange">It would seem very tiring to change the Electoral College. There are so many rules and amendments that they would have to change. They would also have to change the number of votes that the president has to get. I think it would be better if they left the Electoral College the way it is.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.39729347,<span style="color:white">0.597230162</span>,0.0054763622399999]</span> </br></br>The last reason why they shouldn't change the Electoral College is because it wouldn't be the same. <span style="color:white">There are so many great Amendments that should remain the same. It would be chaos if they changed the Amendments. Plus a lot of people would have even more opinions about why they changed the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.649124898</span>,0.348499448,0.0023756514]</span> . <span style="color:white">The Electoral College should remain the same.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.199579742</span>,0.7939915599999999,0.00642871688]</span>
