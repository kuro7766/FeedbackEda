Other events may be weighing down heavily on a student's mind, causing their face to contort and convey the emotions brought on from factors outside of the learning setting. A change in emotion not caused by a difficult lesson plan would cause the software to possibly alter the lesson pace when the student did not require any adjustment and ultimately generate frustration in the already distressed student.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000706170194,0.0433023005999999,<span style="color:white">0.955991528</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Although each day, more and more opportunities to develop and improve technology and learning are created, sometimes these brilliant innovations do not mesh well with education.
