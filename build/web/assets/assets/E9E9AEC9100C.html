<span style="color:orange">Student should designed the summer project</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">it gives them more freedom</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">more experience</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange"><span style="color:orange">it is life-changing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">However, not everyone would agree with this position. Some people may argue that teacher should designed the summer project. For example it challengingÂ and you will learn more.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  Nevertheless, there are other viewpoint to consider.</br></br>To begin with, <span style="color:orange">it gives you more freedom</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . For example, <span style="color:white">in India there was a kid named Generic_Name, sometime when the teacher was not in the class room. He always help his class mates, one day his teacher give them a project and he decide to do a toy little rocket, also he decide to test the rocket and it worked. And now he win the grand winner award by the President of India.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>In addition, it gives you <span style="color:orange">more experience</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . For example, <span style="color:white">in schools teacher are the one who do all the work, and if a student did not do his work, it will be a waste of time for the student and the teacher. If we allow student to make their own work they will know how hard is also they gain experience by doing the project by them self.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Finally, <span style="color:orange"><span style="color:orange">it is life-changing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  For example, <span style="color:orange">in Generic_City schools they have to take every class every year and some extra load on the top. But expert for one thing it was summer school project, because they want their student to relay on their self not on the others. Sometime when you do the work on your own, you known how hard is the work and you will more learn by the work you did in the end.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>If we allow the student to do their work on their self. They will know how hard is it and they will force their self to the limit to do better at ever thing they do, also it gain <span style="color:orange">more experience</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  to do it right and freedom to think of an idea they have and life-changing is the one put it to together in the end to make it better.
