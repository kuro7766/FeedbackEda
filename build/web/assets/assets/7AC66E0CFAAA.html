Dear,</br></br>State Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I argue in the favor of keeping the electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think that it really doesn't matter what a single person vote can do. One vote will not make a difference. The state uses the americans vote, to see what we would pefer.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Every vote an</br></br></br></br>important</br></br>' person makes, it counts that.</br></br>I personally think its a waist of time to vote,that us americans really have no say so in. I bet that if we all didn't vote this next go around, we would still have a president. All because, of what the</br></br></br></br>important</br></br>' people want. All 538 electors know who is better for the United States of America. So, why we vote?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The only thing against the electoral college, is what we might call the</br></br>Disaster Factor.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Back, in 1960, segregationist, in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with the new electors who would oppese John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)</br></br>The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism. a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be {overruled} by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing the the electoral college method id not democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president. NOT the people. When you cote for a presidential candidate you're actaully voting for a slate of electos.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">So, you might as well just let the electoral collge do the job. I mean if you want to go and vote mor power to you. But, like I said its a waist of time to do so!!!</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Thank you for reading,</br></br>Ashlee
