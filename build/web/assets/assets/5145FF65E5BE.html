So we have to think about the future and implement it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">First, the author says "Venus, sometimes called the "Evening Star." Before Venus is called actually a planet, Venus was not popular. Venus and it was not called anything. But after Venus had called a planet, many things have been discovering bu scientist or other. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionary the closest in distance too.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It means we have a possibility to live in there. Veuns still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. Again, we need to find the another place to live for the future.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">If we leave this problem as it is, every people will die because Earth is warming up year to year and we are on the crisis.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Secound, we have startedthe project for travel to planet which is not Earth that is easily to go. The problem and NASA have a relationship as traveling planet. NASA had done a lot of project about space. NASA also has one particulaly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">It is not easy to travel to Venus or another planet, but we have possibility because of them skill. It is survivable for humans.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Finally, the auther says,"Venus would need to get up close and parsonal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> " <span style="color:white">We need to think about it. If we could live in Venus, it must be same as Earth, because there is the enviroment like this that we live. We alive. We have ocean for water, sun light, plants, oxygen, houses, foods, or something. We have to think about these problem, too.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It is not far from right now to travel to Venus and we could it, we could get a chance to live Venus. If we can, we should be more comfortable. We need to study Venus and teach many people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
