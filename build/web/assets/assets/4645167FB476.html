To: principle</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think it is a great idea to help the community</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:white">because there are some people that don't even care about the earth as much some other people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">also i think that when you are eating lunch you should clean up around yourself. also when you don't have anything to do you should help pick up things and you can throw it where it should be thrown in and that is the trash. After you do what you are supposed to do you can do that every day and that is how you will help our community</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Also when you have helped you should go to other places and if you see trash on the floor pick it up even if its not your's. Another thing is when people throw things on the floor tell them to pick it up and if they don t pick it up for them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">and also you can help the community by telling your friends and maybe they would help you clean up litter and that way you wont be the only one helping you can be the first person to start</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">and also you can feel really good that you aren't only helping yourself you are helping others</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">and there will be a large amount of people helping the community. And you can start your own little group by you going on television and telling the people to start helping our community so that way we are not the only people helping it could travel out threw all of the earth and there will be a bigger difference.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>
