``<span style="color:white">Hey OTHER_NAME want to performs some community service hours and pick up some trash.'' ``Ill think about it,'' my friend OTHER_NAME said as he walked away. I dint think he is going to think about it.

When i was there i saw a sign that said volunteer hours from 6-7 pm Monday threw Friday. I thought in my head wowo what a great opportunity. I took on the challenge and i was amazed at the outcome of what i did. Every thing in that area was as clean as a wisthe. I thought to myself wow look what community service can do. I also recall a time when i was ten years old i saw this animal walking down the street. I was amazed because i saw this big soda can on his head. I went to go take it off and i found out something else. The poor little bird was chocking on a piece of paper. I called animal serevice right away for help. They the bird and saved its life. I thought to myself, now if somebody would have threw it in the garbage this would of never happend.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.29631989,<span style="color:white">0.4877908619999999</span>,0.2158892132]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, community service is great i think people should do more of it. Just one hour of it can make a difference. Even just picking up something up from the floor can make a change. Do it for the animals and yourself.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0556749186,<span style="color:white">0.805421202</span>,0.1389038792]</span>
