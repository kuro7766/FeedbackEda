Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that yes, our school should participate in community service such as picking up litter and helping out elders and elementary children.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  The reason being because</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think in this society now a days children and others need to take a little more of responsibility and also it will make a change in our society</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Imagine if ,for example us kids and adults helped out elementary children, such as being a tutor, kids would get better grades on the star testing and SAT's.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Another reason would be it would help out with discipline</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">A lot of children need to understand the meaning of discipline, self control, and respect. If we as kids started helping elementary children with school, not only grades but etiquette and respect, people in general would be nicer and maybe at our schools now a days their wouldn't be as many bullies.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also, in the elder department it would also be a big help for children at our scho</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> ol. <span style="color:orange">The reason being is that it would help us, once again be respectful and understand that in life, you get old, and sometimes gaining age could effect your memory or even, take over how your body works. We could also learn to live life to the fullest and stop caring about who has the new phone or purse exc.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Lastly, having community service could get us ready to have a stable job and understand the responsibility of it when we have one</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . W<span style="color:white">ho wants to get fired on the first day right?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>So yes, principal, I do think at our school we should put out <span style="color:orange">community service it will help us children with responsibility, respect, and discipline.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>  Thank you.
