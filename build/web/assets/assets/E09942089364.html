<span style="color:orange">What would I say if I were a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens, when I don't? I would first off say they're are no such things as aliens. There is no evidence that aliens are real. The only evidence we have are pictures that people send in of "UFOs" or "aliens" being spotted. Seriously those pictures could be easily edited with the power of the internet.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.2193633228,<span style="color:white">0.7378762560000001</span>,0.0427603932]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Face is just a natural landform!</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0711927704,<span style="color:white">0.89020002</span>,0.0386071926]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The Face, like many other landforms, looks (hince the name) like a face!
