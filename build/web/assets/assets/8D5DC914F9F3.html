You're in a driverless car and the car begins to accelerate, however it doesnt meet a constant speed. As the car continues to go faster and faster, its to late to stop because you already rearended the car infront of you. Causing the person in the car infront of you to spin out of controll and hit a telephone pole. Because of a computer error in the car an inicent bystander's life has been taken. That there just shows the potental danger the driverless car has just due to the "auto acceleration" programing in the car.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0250638342999999,<span style="color:white">0.3774053739999999</span>,0.5975307860000001]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">In that car crash you have to give the poliece your insurance redgerstration ext.
