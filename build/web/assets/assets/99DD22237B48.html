Dear Senador</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I personally think that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The people around count of having a better life in the country but not giving they what they want will bring big problems the nation. Its overruled to decleared the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner you have to be fair. It doesn't matter if you have more popular votes than others you have to win by having regular votes. The Electoral Colleges metod is not being democratic at all in modern sence. And it seems like is the electors who elect the president, not the people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The trust of the peole had been betrayed. It is the entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the natonal popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There's five reason for retaining the Electoral College despite its democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons: 1) Certainty of Outcome 2)Everyone's President 3)Swing State 4)Big State and last but not less 5)Avoid Run-Off Elections.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">So why not do one of them. Why not? Because your scared that your democracy will fail or not win. But whats more important you or your nation?</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
