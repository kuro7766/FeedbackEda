Dear Mr. Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I do not think you should make it mandatory for everyone to do community service for a few reasons.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The first is because you shouldn't make someone do something they really don't want to do even if you think it is good for them because you are not there parent.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Another reason is because if you make people do community service they will do the bare minimum of work that they are suppose to do or teach a child how to do math wrong, or read words a different way then everyone else.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If they are cleaning up trash i doubt they would do all the work they're suppose to. I bet they might only pick up a couple pieces of trash, and complain about it the whole time</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> <span style="color:orange">. I understand it might help the community a little</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  b<span style="color:orange">ut if they do no work or teach a child who's learning to read the wrong way it will take so much more work to help fix what that person has done.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I get that your trying to help, but all i think it will do is make things much worse for the school and the community</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">I also think that you should make as much school time as you have to do actual school work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">You could open up another band class or give us study hall sense we don't have it or maybe make home base even longer.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Find another way to help students and the community. There are a lot of things you can do to help. Just don't force people to do community work. Its just going to make things so much worse,</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
