Phones and driving</br></br><span style="color:orange">Many teenagers have their phones as their top priority. Many of them are on them all the time even while driving. Texting while driving is one of many causes of death in the United States. These young 16 year olds don't understand that not only are they putting their life in danger but they are putting the person beside them, in front of them, and behind them in danger.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0428983046,<span style="color:white">0.85535506</span>,0.1017466252]</span>  With that being said <span style="color:orange">phones should not be aloud to be operated by a human in any sort of way while driving.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.127220014,<span style="color:white">0.8591371280000001</span>,0.0136428344]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Teenagers do not understand the meaning of putting your phone down.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.3004957259999999</span>,0.688313614,0.01119071472]</span>  <span style="color:white">If so many teenagers would just pay attention to what's going on around them they would understand what's going on in the world.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.487529814</span>,0.50851249,0.00395770456]</span>  <span style="color:orange">As a teenager i feel as so that if Georgia passed a law on hands free driving there should be more cops out.

You only get to live your life once and so do the people around you. Don't think that looking at your phone for one second won't change anything because it could change everything. You can look at your phone when you get home or when your parked in a parking lot. Snapchat can wait and a text to your boyfriend/girlfriend can wait because your life and the peoples lives around you are more important than one quick text.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0619802232,<span style="color:white">0.891936866</span>,0.0460829032]</span>
