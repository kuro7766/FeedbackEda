<span style="color:orange">Hello, my name is Hannah. I am a scientist at NASA who has been studying the "face" on Mars over the years. Today my close friend Mason had asked me about any imformation I've found out recently.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.158091294,<span style="color:white">0.808112976</span>,0.0337957174]</span>  I said,"<span style="color:orange">Well, it just appears to be a natural formation rather than something that was created."</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0509640734,<span style="color:white">0.8866782280000001</span>,0.0623576832]</span>  <span style="color:orange">He argued and argued over how the aliens built it,and how its just been hidden all these years.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.3981311259999999,<span style="color:white">0.590663712</span>,0.0112051663]</span> </br></br>In a shorter explaination I told Mason that <span style="color:orange">the shadows show how they do on Earth on natural formations.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0745921422,<span style="color:white">0.8635832640000001</span>,0.0618245954]</span>  He didn't quite get it so <span style="color:white">I showed him a messa and how they shadow.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.310127194</span>,0.679693594,0.010179203]</span>  <span style="color:orange">He still thought the marsians made the formation of the face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.228257728,<span style="color:white">0.755885418</span>,0.0158568670599999]</span> </br></br>The next day, he talked to me about the same thing. Only this time I knew that I could prove to him that <span style="color:orange">the "face" was only natural.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.090399362,<span style="color:white">0.86463518</span>,0.0449654558]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I pulled up the pictures taken over the years and let Mason examine them very carefully. The picture taken in 2001 shows that there is nothing else around the face. If there was anyhting on the ground such as an airplane or a shack, you have been able to tell what it was. But there was nothing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.154967422,<span style="color:white">0.79977208</span>,0.0452604999999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Mason still didn't agree that the form on Mars was a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.1131786433999999,<span style="color:white">0.8614297220000001</span>,0.0253916164]</span> </br></br>It was now the third day he has argued over the face on Mars. But this day, Mason didnt argue with me. <span style="color:orange">He asked to see the pictures again, along with pictures of a messa and a butte, which are natural landforms here on Earth. Mason looked for hours and hours and hours. He finally spoke up,"Maybe you guys here at NASA are right.. It seems to be completely natural.."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0953047116,<span style="color:white">0.857404242</span>,0.0472910554]</span>  I replied,"I told you old pal. Next time you should look into something more before you argue about it."</br></br>The next morning Mason came to work with me. The other scientists and I all came agreed that the face on Mars was completely natural. <span style="color:orange">Not only did NASA finally figure out how to "unmask the face" and call it a natural landform, but they also provided a lot of information that way people understood it better. To this day the "face" is known to be a natural landform!</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0502773154,<span style="color:white">0.8719277</span>,0.0777949884]</span>
