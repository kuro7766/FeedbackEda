<span style="color:orange">Extracurricular activities are great but do we need them? The principal deciding we must participate in at least one is not well thought upon. Us as students are not all the same and live very different life styles.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I disagree with the principals actions</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because, <span style="color:orange">there is no time</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">some families can not afford it</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , and <span style="color:orange">most can not even get a way there!</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br>I say <span style="color:orange">there is no time</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  because students have homework, jobs, or even take care of a family member. <span style="color:white">Teens do sports if they want to have fun. A percentage of teens do not enjoy sports. There are even the teens that want to do sports but can't because their parents are working all the time! I am one of those teens. Most parents are busy so it is not us teens being lazy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Another reason I disagree is because <span style="color:orange">a lotÂ of families have no money!</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">By "no money" I don't mean the have none at all, I am saying that they need the extra money for food, gas, clothing, etc. Playing sports or being in a extracurricular activity costs money. That money can go to better Things. Having that little bit of extra money is what is keeping some families off the streets.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">No money? No car! Along with having no money and no time, you have no way to get there!</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If a students parents can not pick them up they can't go. A lot of students are only children so they do not have an older sibling to pick them up. Even if students are old enough to drive it is very unlikely for them to have their own vehicle.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">No time, no money and no way to get to your extracurricular activity means you would get kicked out of it. These are my reasons for disagreeing with the principal. If you can't or don't want to, you shouldn't have to.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
