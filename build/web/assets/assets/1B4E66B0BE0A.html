Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog, the smog rivale Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gas. Diesel make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines.

President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions is to shift in American behavior. Research studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The United States has long been one of the world's prime car cultures. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005. "What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn," says Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation</br></br>Research Institute. The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, <span style="color:orange">there are many different advantages to limiting car usage because of pollution, many different acts of transportation, and because of Car Culture.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
