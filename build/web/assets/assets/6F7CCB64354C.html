Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br>Hello , my name is STUDENT_NAME. I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME. <span style="color:orange">I've heard that you were changing the school policy , and that you wanted to hear from the students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  I would love for you to take the chance to read my letter . Thank You</br></br>As I stated before <span style="color:white">I've heard about the changes you want to make and I have a lot of suggestion on it</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span>  . One of them is that may be <span style="color:orange">after school programs is the only way some of the students stay out of trouble</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So then with you taking that away from them, they will have nothing else to do . Then they will turn to the streets, and i know you wouldn't want that for our fellow students .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Also <span style="color:orange">may be them getting a C grade average is the best they can do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Then our school wouldn't have the best after school activities we could have. Then the people who enjoy it the most , but doesn't meet the standard wouldn't have the ability to get a scholar ship in it even if they need it the most.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  Another reason is that, <span style="color:orange">without after school activities students wouldn't really be able to work out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Then we would have even more students turning obesity.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>I would really like to thank you for reading my letter and giving my suggestions a thought . I hope you really think about them. Also and try not to just take our activities for granted. Once again thank you.</br></br>Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
