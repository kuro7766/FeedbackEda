"Unmasking the face on Mars"</br></br>"Big News" <span style="color:yellow">NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft has found something while circling</br></br>Mars. But what is it, they have seem to have found a face formed into the rocks. Is this new discovery actually a face or is it just another rock formation.</br></br>The believers and the non-believers of the face on Mars are waiting anxiously to find out what it is.

NASA had come to Mars to take a picture of the face at the wrong time and if they were to come another day they might have been able to see that it was an actual face and not just some rock formation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0871815412,<span style="color:white">0.8206040739999999</span>,0.092214378]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Around the American West there are common landforms know as butte or mesa and they are actually equivalent to the Martian.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0671170724,0.8792160499999999,<span style="color:white">0.0536668916</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Could the butte or mesa landforms be know on other planets besides ours?</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1059580066,<span style="color:white">0.8373536100000001</span>,0.0566883547999999]</span>  We are able to get the right size because " as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size" so be comparing the actual size of the butte or mesa to right about the size of the Martian when we do the math. The land formation on earth reminds people most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho " thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars".</br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion the Face on Mars is just another regular plain old natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0558305202,<span style="color:white">0.905686984</span>,0.0384825166]</span>  <span style="color:white">" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even a shack."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.337685702</span>,0.64864641,0.0136678856]</span>
