Voters in toss-up should mainly be able to decide the election because they usually really listen to the competing candidates so they are usually the most thoughtful. Votes in big states aren't fair to smaller states because presidential candidates give alot of attention to big states than to small states.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.310654898,<span style="color:white">0.6653985459999999</span>,0.0239465526]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electoral College, can sometimes give voters no hope to the candidate they want to win because electors could vote for the other candidate. An example is, Republicans in a state might eventually know that their vote will have no effect so they end up paying less attention the the competing presidential candidates. I think that thats a reason how plurality happens and voters think its unfair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0850807408,<span style="color:white">0.825184084</span>,0.0897351676]</span>
