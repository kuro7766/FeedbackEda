Unmasking the Face on Mars</br></br><span style="color:white">Well on my opinion I don't think the face is a natural landform,</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">in the text it states- twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">If the face has been apart of Mars for ONLY twenty five years I don't think is was apart of martian life, it would've already been discovered a long time ago.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">I honestly think it has been made up by an illusion.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Stated in paragraph three, NASA uveiled the image for all to see, it was a huge rock formation, which resmebled an humans head making out the shaped of nose, eyes, and mouth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They thought reasoning this situation of Mars would be a great way to grab the public's attention to Mars. It did.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Ever since then it has became an pop icon, so now that i think about it, It does'nt seem like it was apart of martian life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They so far haven't even caught real martian life on planet Mars. So I don't even know how to think that NASA could determine it was apart of alien life on Mars. It possibly could be but I don't think anything could live on the surface of that COLD planet.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It puzzles me that it just randomly popped up out of nowhere and has been located at that very spot for twenty five years, why could this happen now?</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">I don't know maybe later in discovery the scientists of NASA will find out what and why this happened. NASA's budget wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars. I guess we'll have to find out later in the future.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>How could they possibly determine it's real? Let's make a couple guesses.</br></br><span style="color:white">The "Face on Mars" has been starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, articles, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Now you know why people are so amazed of being able to read about this story and give NASA so much feedbacks about this "Face on Mars" story. One day they'll determine what'll happen.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
