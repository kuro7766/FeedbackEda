I helped out elder and cleaned beaches it was fun to me and I believe that it would be good for our school to require community service not just for the town and people but for themselves to feel personal pride in that they did for there community and themselves. It would be a great thing to do for our school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.01195830802,0.325436129,<span style="color:white">0.662605588</span>]</span> </br></br>From,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
