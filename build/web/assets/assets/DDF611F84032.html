Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:white">All or most of the students like to be involved in a lot of things and do something that they enjoy doing or like to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that the students with average of a grade C should be able to participate in sport and other activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Students with grade C should be able to participate in sport and activities</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">because C is not bad of a grade! It is still considered as a passing grade in all the grades. If most of the students have a grade C as an average and they wouldn't be able to participate in sports or activities, then there will be almost no students involved in anything!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think that activities are not the distraction for students not to study very well to get a B,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">it is most likely they don't want to or just spend time doing something else out of school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If the students wouldn't be able to participate in school sports or activities they are more likely to go and do things out of school, and be involved in something else as well. All the kids like different activities and I think that they should have an opportunity not just study everyday, but also have some fun and do different things to prepare them for their future.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When a student would only be allowed to study and not to participate in anything else they wouldn't have any time to have a break or to relax from a long day that they had in school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Students participating in sports and activities helps them take down the stress</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">that they might of had in school, with friends or in a family, by doing sports or being involved in other activities and being able to communicate with others. That takes their mind of something that had bothered them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Therefore, <span style="color:orange">I think that students with an average of a grade C should be able to participate in sports and activities. To have fun with friends and doing things they like. Also, taking the stress down and having something else to do out of school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
