Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:white">All or most of the students like to be involved in a lot of things and do something that they enjoy doing or like to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1670648092</span>,0.79516896,0.0377661972]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that the students with average of a grade C should be able to participate in sport and other activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0410096248,<span style="color:white">0.880644496</span>,0.078345856]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Students with grade C should be able to participate in sport and activities</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0651647944,<span style="color:white">0.8807360799999999</span>,0.0540991267999999]</span> , <span style="color:orange">because C is not bad of a grade! It is still considered as a passing grade in all the grades.
