<span style="color:orange">In my opinion I think Policy 1 would be the best. Using cell phones in are free time would be better than not using them at all. They should also be off when they are in classes or taking test</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Some people like to talk to there friends about what happen over the phone last night and want to show them the text messages. Plus teenagers love to talk to people so when there friend is in another room they can text them what happened in there class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Not having phones at all in school wouldn't be to good. Some people might have something important to tell there parents.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Like if they were staying after just send a quick text or call them, rater than having to wait in the office to just say "I am staying after." There could also be an emergency like a family member died or things like that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">People could also just need to talk to people in school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Like asking them if they can have a ride home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">They also could be talking to someone very important. Like a cousin from another state or someone from a different school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I agree with Policy 1. Text in free time, lunch, and at their lockers. A lot of people would love to text people during class. I don't think they should call in class because they could be texting answers to there friends who wasn't in that class yet. That's why there should be off when they are in class. After school would also work to like when they are walking to there bus or to there car. I agree with policy 1.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
