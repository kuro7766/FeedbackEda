<span style="color:white">Okay hey,  I just wanted to introduce myself before we get into this subject my name is PROPER_NAME and i'm writing about changing the Electoral College to election by popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.33577157</span>,0.632039838,0.032188609]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The reason why I am writing about this is because there are a lot of things wrong with the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.14250405,<span style="color:white">0.809597228</span>,0.0478987198]</span>  and <span style="color:yellow">under that sytem, voters don't vote for presidents they vote for slate of electors who then elect the president and can elect someone completely different than who the voter wanted to be president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.090561572,0.78899336,<span style="color:white">0.1204450718</span>]</span>  <span style="color:white">So there is a possiblity that your not going to wind up getting what you wanted out of the outcome.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.4794637</span>,0.509532952,0.01100331872]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also in electoral vote the most worrying thing is the prospect of a tie.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.175257862,<span style="color:white">0.7567646480000001</span>,0.0679775148]</span>  <span style="color:white">In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations vote on the president.
