There are many people out there that believe it is just a natural landform. People think that because there are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face so why think that aliens did it just because it is on another planet. Also they might not belive in aliens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1316871032</span>,0.8443971100000001,0.0239158038]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There are also people who think aliens created it.

Since it is on Mars they instantly think aliens. They think aliens because they can't think of what else could cause that and they think aliens can do crazy things like shape the land. Also people read things from newspaper articles that talk about it and watch movies about aliens and see them do crazy things like shape the land and other crazy things.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.204844692</span>,0.773023558,0.0221317588]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">People who think the face is just a natural landform probably think the people that believe aliens made it are crazy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.0899589771999999</span>,0.8820960440000001,0.0279449596]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They might think they are crazy because there is no proof that aliens exist, so why think that something that might not exist create something like a face in a planet. It makes more sense that it is a natural landform that just so happens to resemble a face. Not many scientists believed it was an alien artifact so many people would think that is a natural landform because scientists don't believe it is something aliens created.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.152654494,<span style="color:white">0.8205842539999999</span>,0.0267612454]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">On April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his "Mars Orbiter Camera" took a picture of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the original and it proved that it was just a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0405169872,0.867539202,<span style="color:white">0.0919438408</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">People who believed aliens created it were unsatisfied because the way Mars faced in 98' it was winter time.
