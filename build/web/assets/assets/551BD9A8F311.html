This means that the presidential candidate cannot get votes based on the region they are from. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a President. He gains no votes by increasing pluraity in states that he knows he will win. This results with unlikely success of the President.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.185981664,<span style="color:white">0.70622126</span>,0.107797066]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1427613186,<span style="color:white">0.6791008680000001</span>,0.178137814]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.
