"Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found". After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear air pollution of the global city". Monday motorists with even number license plates were ordered to leave their car at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)". The same would apply to odd number plates the following day". The congestion went down sixty percent in the Capital of France, the smog cleared enough monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates on Tuesday.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.207645102,<span style="color:white">0.6866612200000001</span>,0.105693678]</span> </br></br>Secondly, <span style="color:orange">another example of a car free day is in Bogota, Colombia.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1242220152,<span style="color:white">0.825843112</span>,0.0499348792]</span>  <span style="color:orange">"Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work on car-free day". This day in Bogota has been celebrated for three years straight now, "where cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of seven million". The goal of this day is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Even when it rains on car free day in Bogota this doesn't stop people from participating," says Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. A businessman says "it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1375575188,<span style="color:white">0.7436328919999999</span>,0.118809584]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, <span style="color:yellow">countries all over the world are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and smog. Paraguay, France, Colombia, and even America is trying to get people to use different types of transportation and reduce smog. So citizens all over the world should just for one day not use a car.

We can make earth a better place and more healthy enviroment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0386196169999999,0.6798938959999999,<span style="color:white">0.281486484</span>]</span>
