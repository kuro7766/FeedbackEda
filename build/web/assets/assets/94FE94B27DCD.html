Dear, TEACHER_NAME</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe our school should have community service.</br></br>Why ?</br></br>Because, students should not litter on school property and make our school look trashy.</br></br>School is a place to learn not to litter and destroy the schools</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  .</br></br>In the following paragraphs, I will persuade you to require school community service in our school.</br></br><span style="color:orange">In SCHOOL_NAME, the population of litter is huge.</br></br>Students here think after using an object and its time to dispose it, it belongs on the ground.</br></br>All students at SCHOOL_NAME</br></br>should take part and help.</br></br>Making our school look better will be a big helping hand.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">By that I want to totally help to clean up our school !</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I would first make a survey. Post it out in each hallway in the school.</br></br>Then I would have every student to sign yes if they think its a good idea to have community service or no.</br></br>With the following students that has pick yes I will call a meeting.</br></br>Next I would ask them what days are good to stay after school and clean or can they come everyday.</br></br>The students that will not take part of this act I would make another community service.</br></br>Our school looks horrible especially the break areas.</br></br>Also the court yard of the school pavement need to be refill with concrete.</br></br>The school walls, classrooms, and hallways need to be repainted.</br></br>The graffiti on the hallways wall and outside the school building walls need to be painted over.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>I strongly believe us students can do it.</br></br><span style="color:orange">With this all said and done, Principle TEACHER_NAME I have may reasons why you should require school community service. First I believe our school should have community service because it looks trashy not classy.</br></br>Second because students think trash belongs on the ground. My third reason is because inside the school building needs repainting.</br></br>Most all ,all students should take part in this act to make our school look like a school not a public park !</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
