Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Our community probably doesn't look as mush as perfect as you see it. There's a lot of people out there that throw trash around or don't cut the grass from abandoned buildings.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0863002058,<span style="color:white">0.7969519660000001</span>,0.1167478498]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I've been thinking that is maybe the time to step it up and get all the students to at least to an hour of community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0632540096,<span style="color:white">0.8337445240000001</span>,0.103001476]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">You should probably require students to do community service. I mean, it's for the community to look better.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0494125536,<span style="color:white">0.804103686</span>,0.146483757]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I did that in sixth grade and I can do it my last year here too. It's not a really fun experience but I'm going to do it for other people to be thankful of me too.</br></br>We should probably start by a Saturday instead of being at home bored not getting you anywhere. Starting by groups seems like a good start I would enjoy that.</br></br>Another excellent time would be in the summer. It's practically when more people go out and go by our community. It will look really nice if we would do a little clean up to it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.217763572,<span style="color:white">0.564336742</span>,0.2178996846]</span>  <span style="color:white">Please, get us students to that job.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.448993946</span>,0.5437076279999999,0.00729845492]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It doesn't take time away from me, I could see my friends another time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1132010534,<span style="color:white">0.829382868</span>,0.0574160812]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
