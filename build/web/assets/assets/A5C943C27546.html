The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. It is crazy imaging Venus having way more pressure than Earth. The text sasy, "Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupying volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes." This shows that Venus has many powerful climate changes.
