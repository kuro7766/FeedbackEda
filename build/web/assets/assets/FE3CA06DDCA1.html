As in this sit ions where my friend needed some advice for a test she had coming up. She was not sure what to do to study for it. She was telling me what she had to study but then she said ÃÂ¨ I donÃÂ´t think these would help me muchÃÂ¨ I told her to make flash cards out of the note she had then she did that. She was super stress. I think when your stressed you just say things that are on your mind as in you talk more.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.271423662,<span style="color:white">0.71513886</span>,0.01343747066]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If a person wants good advice they will want to give you all the details.
