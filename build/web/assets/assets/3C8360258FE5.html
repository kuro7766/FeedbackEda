<span style="color:orange">Have ever asked someone for their opinion on something and then turn around and ask someone else the exact same question, and then you just keep asking more and more people for their opinions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Well what if I told you that it was a good thing and keep asking for their opinions,and here are my reasons why</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . My first reason is that <span style="color:orange">it helps you understand how other people feel about the matter.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  Another reason to get more than one persons opinion on a matter is because <span style="color:orange">you might like what the person has to say.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  My last reason is that <span style="color:orange">we all have an opinion so lets share it with each other and you may agree and you might disagree but that is life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">When someone tells you their opinion on a matter you can tell how they by the sound of their voice or by their body movement</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . Knowing how some feels on a matter helps you understand where their point of view is coming from. <span style="color:orange">Like with the new virus that is spreading it is a big discussion all over the world talking about it some are scared and some are happy because they are shutting down schools al over the world, but what I'm trying to say is it is all in their point of view.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>When you get someone else point of view in a matter you might like what the have to say. <span style="color:orange">Like when i was younger me and my friends had a argument about who had the better phones and I liked what they had to say and I gave my point. See how I listened and it turned out that they said something I liked but at the same time I still gave my opinion. You will ever know what they might say so listen and you might like it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>You might listen to what they have to say but still not agree with it, <span style="color:white">but you can't just start blurting out stuff and talk over them you have to wait. Once they finish talking then you can say what you have to say but there still is no guarantee that they will agree with you.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>
