<span style="color:white">A electors  college is a process , not a place. The electoral college was established it is the constitution as a conpromise betweet election of the presendent by a vote in congress and electection of the presendent by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

In that case, the election would be thrwn to the house of representatives, where state delegation vote on the presendent. And the thing is that the senate would choose the vice-presendent. because each state cast only one vote, the single representative from wyoming, representing 5000,000 votes would have sa much say as the 55 representative from carofornia, who represent 35 million votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.6850436639999999</span>,0.308943174,0.00601312698]</span>
