<span style="color:yellow">It is the morning after the election, the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and you are joyful as can be, Why?  Last night's vote showed that your president that you wanted to win was going to be the next President of the United States of America.  You go to your laptop, open the screen, and there, in bold letters it says that the candidate you did not want to win was sitting there in the Oval Office.  You are in shock. Your friends call you and ask you what happened. Did something go wrong? Did we miss any extra votes last night?  You go look at the votes, they are still the same.  Then you relize that the Electoral College did not care what the people of this country said. The Electoral College did not care in one candidate had 100,000 more votes than the other.  All they wanted is everything to go their way.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0635885913999999,0.345986128,<span style="color:white">0.5904252799999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">I think we should get rid of the the Electoral College.

It also states that the presidental candidates can also vote for the electors not just the people and the state.  But what is not fair, is that the voters can not always control who the electors vote for.  The citizens should be able to vote for the president they want.  The man or woman they want to run their country. The people of the United States vote to make this country a better place for everyone.  Because they believe their candidate that they vote for will make this country a better place.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1027835333999999,<span style="color:white">0.50399987</span>,0.3932166159999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Furthermore the Electoral College is the stupides thing I ever heard of and i think we should get rid of it</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.115159899</span>,0.7314457180000001,0.1533943814]</span> .  <span style="color:white">I agree with the aritcal "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong," because it says, "that the electoral college says is unfair, outdated, and irrational."
