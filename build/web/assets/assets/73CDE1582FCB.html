<span style="color:orange">Public schools are not always the best to attend. Thats why some schools have other options for kids/ parents that dont want to attend them or dont want there children attending them. There usually a lot of bad situations that happen in public schools. There a lot of disrespect that come from the students that dont care about school. Students skip classes to fight or be disruptive.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0974459125999999,<span style="color:white">0.8779773219999999</span>,0.0245767693999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This is why i think Homeschooling or home bound is a wonderful thing to have.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0876701071999999,<span style="color:white">0.904415618</span>,0.00791428348]</span>  <span style="color:white">Some kids never wanna get up and come to school so they end up skipping school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1023437772</span>,0.886689488,0.01096675208]</span>  <span style="color:white">So having this "Distance Learning" stuff is a wonderful thing to have.

The one bad thing about home bound is that you cant work while on home bound.

I feel that we learn better when were alone and get to study a subject or unit as long as we need so we know it. In school units get taught so fast that students that learn slower than others dont really have a chance to get to know it. In conclusion i love the fact that we have al these different opertunitys for everyone.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.072747434</span>,0.904473434,0.0227791439999999]</span>
