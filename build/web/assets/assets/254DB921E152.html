Earth's twin is Venus, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and the size. Earth, Venus and Mars are neighboring planets they all orbit the sun at different speeds. No man has been on Venus NASA has tried to send spaceships up to Venus but the ships never survived the landing some did but they didn't make it past a few hours. Venus has never been touched by man.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.559533916</span>,0.43837621,0.0020898652]</span> </br></br>The author has lots of good pionts about Venus and the is it worth to study. <span style="color:white">The auther has good pionts he claims the average temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees and that the atmosheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.2352371999999999</span>,0.761638954,0.00312385056]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The auther makes good pionts of why we should study this planet, to learn to expand our minds into space.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.2444159259999999,<span style="color:white">0.752696802</span>,0.00288728862]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Spending resources on studying planets is a good and a bad.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.399837032,<span style="color:white">0.5986132900000001</span>,0.00154968146]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Studying planet that can't help us is a wate of time, finding a planet out there that have air and can grow plants is a big find and we should study those planets.
