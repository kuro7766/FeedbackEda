Dear principal,</br></br><span style="color:white">I just heard that you are trying to decide on a very big topic. I thought i would wright you a letter to let you know what I think.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I fell that you should require every student to do some sort of community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  There are two simple reasons why I think that you should require community service. My first reason is that <span style="color:orange">it teaches the kids good live lessons</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , and the second reason is that <span style="color:orange">will make other schools maybe try it to</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> .</br></br>Community service can teach life lessons. <span style="color:yellow">Some kids look at community service as a bad thing. When you think of community service most people would think of picking up trash. Say a student hated picking up trash but for community service made him pick up trash. He would learn form this to mot litter because there are people that go around and pick up trash and now he know what it is like. Another example is say a student helping out at a nursing-home. this student could of not like to be around old people. now he would be able to see that the elders are not that bad.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br>My second and last reason is that maybe other schools will see what we are doing and they would try it. <span style="color:orange">Can you just think of another school likening the idea you had of making kids do community service. You could inspire other schools to help make their community's a better place.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I hope you take the time to read this letter and her what i have to say.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>From your student</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
