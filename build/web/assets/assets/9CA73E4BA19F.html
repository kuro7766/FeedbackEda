Others may say that we can come up with better technology to improve safety when traveling other planets in outer space.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0893861294,<span style="color:white">0.7625516600000001</span>,0.1480622006]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author gives their support to the idea of exploring the planet Venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0733184802,<span style="color:white">0.8110397340000001</span>,0.115641782]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Traveling Venus would be dangerous in many ways.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1181886272</span>,0.807183542,0.074627839]</span>  <span style="color:white">For one, it is the second planet closes to the sun so it would be extremely hot. Next, the air pressure would be quite hard for humans to handle as well. In the passage it states, "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." This clearly gives enough information to say that these conditions are more extreme than what any human can handle.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.0640754951999999</span>,0.7200216920000001,0.215902852]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">A way we could be able to visit Venus is if we had better technology.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.118787503,<span style="color:white">0.776494196</span>,0.1047183094]</span>  <span style="color:orange">NASA has had quite a few ideas for sending humans to Venus.
