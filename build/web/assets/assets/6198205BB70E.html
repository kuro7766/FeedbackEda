<span style="color:yellow">Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during break. In doing this, students may be prepared for the upcoming year when they return to school from break. Many people believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed while others believe that they should be student-designed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.01633508624,0.352346378,<span style="color:white">0.631318562</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Summer projects should be student-designed</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0557276576,<span style="color:white">0.581490542</span>,0.3627818099999999]</span>  because of <span style="color:orange">motivation,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0103118726,<span style="color:white">0.36667261</span>,0.623015536]</span>  <span style="color:orange">creativity</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0099902157,<span style="color:white">0.3741532939999999</span>,0.615856506]</span> , and <span style="color:orange">productivity.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.01172280442,<span style="color:white">0.3755008999999999</span>,0.612776264]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Students would have more motivation if their summer projects were designed by themselves.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00404832118,0.270538762,<span style="color:white">0.725412954</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Besides in the summer, students spend most of the year under the authority of their teachers. If the project they design is on their own terms, they would have more motivation to actually complete it. Since they are no longer under the school's rule during the summer, students may feel more motivated to do their project instead of being forced to do so during the school year. Students would also have more motivation if their summer projects were student-designed because they would not be expected to meet the expectations of their teacher. If the student designs their summer project to their specific skill set, the student may be more motivated to complete the project because he or she is capable of reaching their own goals. Students would most likely turn in better work because they are not under the stress of their teachers' expectations. Because of this, students would have more motivation if their summer projects were student-designed,</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00299922626,0.0946070226,<span style="color:white">0.90239375</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Summer projects should be student-designed</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0557276576,<span style="color:white">0.581490542</span>,0.3627818099999999]</span>  so that students may express their <span style="color:orange">creativity</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0099902157,<span style="color:white">0.3741532939999999</span>,0.615856506]</span> .

If the summer project was teacher-designed, the teacher would provide a rubric that exemplifies the specific ways a teacher wants the project to be completed. In doing this, the teacher is not letting the student use their own <span style="color:orange">creativity</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0099902157,<span style="color:white">0.3741532939999999</span>,0.615856506]</span>  to complete their project while still follwoing the rubric, but in their own way.. Creativity should never be restricted by one's own personal opinion.

If the teacher is somewhat forcing the task, it will make students back away from what they need to complete. Since the student them selfÂ is coming up with the project, they must have more motivation to do so which makes the entire process much more productive. Especially during the summer, productivity may decrease because students are no longer in the correct head space that schoolwork requires. If the project is teacher- designed, then the productivity relating to the project will continue to dwindle as well. If the project is student-designed, the time and effort put into the project would heighten which would increase the productivity of the project as well. Hence my reasoning as to why summer projects should be student-designed rather than having them be teacher-designed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00257558476,0.0893265814,<span style="color:white">0.9080978199999998</span>]</span> </br></br>Motivation, <span style="color:orange">creativity</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0099902157,<span style="color:white">0.3741532939999999</span>,0.615856506]</span> , and productivity would all increase if students' summer projects were student-designed.
