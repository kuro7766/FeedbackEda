The government has made two types of ways to vote, Electoral College and popular vote</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I believe that we should go with the popular vote method</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">When voting like this its not a confusing</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">Theres no missing ad campaigns</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , and <span style="color:orange">in the winner take all you dont rule out another persons elector for his chose</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">Using popular vote for electing our president is better then Electoral College i believe because its not that confusing</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">In Electoral College you vote for a wet number of electors and they give their own vote on their behalf. Now with popular vote say one state votes for president b rather then president a then the state votes for president b</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">In ppular vote both presidents are trying to win you over so they will make a campaign. what if you never see the campaign? This is what can happen in the Electoral College method</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If a president knows that a certain state will not vote for them then the president wont perade around there. Therefore the state cant make a correct decision.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>The popular vote method is very diffrent as you have seen in the paragraphs above. <span style="color:orange">One reason I prefer the popular vote method over the Electoral College is do to the winner take all</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">in ruling out the electors that didnt vote for the president. So if theopposing pesident winns the election then he can single you out for note voting for him and i dont believe thats fair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So when it comes to election day which method will you chose? Electoral College or popular vote you know that im going to stick with popular vote because Electoral College can be confusing, the ad campaignsÂ  cna be unfair and ruling out the opposing electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
