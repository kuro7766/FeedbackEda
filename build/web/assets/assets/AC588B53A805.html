But if it is something we probably wont know for another century or a few decades. But if there is extra terrestrial life on Mars we won't know for a very long time. If aliens did create this then where are they, did they just leave Mars or get wiped out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.6274947599999999,<span style="color:white">0.3698324659999999</span>,0.0026727875]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If this was created by aliens they should still be on Mars or at least signs of them should still be there.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.348445536,<span style="color:white">0.647360424</span>,0.00419405942]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The face still kind of looks like a face in 2001 even though it show sand and maybe thats a little mountain. but it still oddly resembles a face. There might be other stuff like this on Mars in uninvestigated areas and maybe one or two have been made by aliens or other life.
