<span style="color:orange">When you see this face like formation what do you think? Aliens, rocks, sand? Well if you thought any of those it would be rocks and sand. Some people actually beleived this was made by extra terrestrials on Mars but no it's not</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This is just a rock formation found by NASA who thought at first it might have been an extra terrestrail creation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This is not an alien creation if it were there would be arms, legs, or maybe a body poking out of the sand and rocks. But if it is something we probably wont know for another century or a few decades. But if there is extra terrestrial life on Mars we won't know for a very long time. If aliens did create this then where are they, did they just leave Mars or get wiped out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If this was created by aliens they should still be on Mars or at least signs of them should still be there.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The face still kind of looks like a face in 2001 even though it show sand and maybe thats a little mountain. but it still oddly resembles a face. There might be other stuff like this on Mars in uninvestigated areas and maybe one or two have been made by aliens or other life. We found water on Mars so something had to have inhabitted Mars atr least once.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Maybe mars was like Earth at one point in time and there was extra terrestrial life on Mars but something made them leave and made Mars just a floating sandy rock in space.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">But the face that they found on Mars was just a mesa, but who knows this could be some crazy alien statue buried underground we won't know for a while though.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
