Also, talking to other classmates throughout your school may give you extra time to study with them or to finish a couple of assignments you were unsure about or needed help on. Communicating with cell phones will provide you extra time to do this by sending a text or giving them a quick call, after all lunch time and free periods don't last forever. This takes less time and gives you extra time for many other priorities you may have.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00284065678,0.1178081339999999,<span style="color:white">0.87935121</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Also, students need a little free time during the school day.

Giving students this time will show that you trust them to do what they are supposed to in class. Plus, students may realize administrators trust them to keep their phones off and in their pockets during class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00911431534,0.330494338,<span style="color:white">0.660391332</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Therefore, providing trust is a key to students.

If this opportunity is given 99% of students may do better in school. Many may think this just gives students a way to have their cell phones out without getting in trouble for it. However, students are actually very responsible and may do the right thing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01437882414,0.401632204,<span style="color:white">0.583988966</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">All in all, changing the cell phone policy will benefit the school in various ways. There needs to be a sense of trust and knowing they have responsibility inside them first. Students aren't always going to do the right thing. However, giving them this time will allow them to escape and talk with friends that they may not see everyday. This new policy will provide everyone with many opportunities that will have a positive effect.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0054598879,0.2638698299999999,<span style="color:white">0.730670272</span>]</span>
