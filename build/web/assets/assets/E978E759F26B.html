If you had this software update and you used it on your friend it would say she is 70 percent upset and 30 percent mad. So now you know she is upset most of the time and you could change that by talking about things with her letting her parents know. Little things like that could change someones life forever.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.06832679,<span style="color:white">0.861210584</span>,0.0704625986]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">My last reason I think it would be helpful is because you would know how everyones feeling.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0914598607999999,<span style="color:white">0.8946454819999999</span>,0.01389463328]</span>  <span style="color:white">The Mona Lisa is to demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while showoing how much a computer can do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.550279394</span>,0.445387034,0.004333560368]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It also says in paragraph 6 that "</br></br>A classroom computer could recogonize when a student is becoming bored or confused". That could also help the teacher out a lot. Some students don't always let the teacher know if they are bored or confused because maybe they are scared or embarssed, but now your teacher would know if you were confused about something. She would be able to help you or do something a little more exciting.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.069166716,<span style="color:white">0.895794654</span>,0.0350386150999999]</span> </br></br>My conclusion paragraph is going to wrap up my essay. <span style="color:orange">As I said in the introduction I think this would be a really good idea for this software update to be in classrooms for teacher and students. I think it would help with teenagers. I gave a couple reasons why I would want this software update or why it would help. I have seen a lot of students falling asleep in class and the teacher just keeps going. I have also been one of those students were I'm really confused but I don't want to say in front of the class so I either don't say anything or I say something to my buddy next to me. Those are my reasons why I am for this Facial Action Coding System.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0374558842,<span style="color:white">0.8893656480000001</span>,0.0731784715]</span>
