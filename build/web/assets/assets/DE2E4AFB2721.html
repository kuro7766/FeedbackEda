<span style="color:yellow">The electoral college is something that has been loved, hated, and debated on for some years now. We couold abolish it or keep it the way it is. Some say the electoral college is undemocratic and unfair to the voters and the candidates. But some say it is the best way to vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0248923628,0.458164062,<span style="color:white">0.516943602</span>]</span>  <span style="color:white">I'ts seen both ways but is there anything we can do about it?

How can there be a tie in the election of the president? Perhaps because sometimes the electors get to thinking in another midset and vote for the wrong candidate...Yes that is poosible. When people vote for there candidate the electors are the ones being selected and aren't always the way they were in their chosing so therefore there can be a serious tip in votes if the electors don't vote for the candidate of the party they were selected by. "In 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a diect election" (Source 2, Paragrph 1).

So when the party selects their electors they are most likely to select the candidate of the party they were selected by. There is also regional appeal,if a president only has diserably mojority of vores in a certain region of the country he is "unlikely to be a succesful president"( Source 3, Paragraph 5) . This is because if a president is only desired by a certain region and not the rest of the country, the wants of the rest of the country aren't met and he most likely will not tend to the needs of them, and ultimately doesn't have a chance of being selected as president. Finally, when no candidate for president has a clear majority of votes, the electoral college's votes gove a clear winner and a candidate is selected.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0272125668,0.2397570892,<span style="color:white">0.733030376</span>]</span> </br></br>Concluding, <span style="color:orange">both sides have reasonable arguments to if the elctoral college will stay for good or be abolished completely.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.155471138,<span style="color:white">0.715224324</span>,0.1293045636]</span>  But it's up tp you to decide which side your own because this is a democracy..
