Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe that students should be able to play sports with a C average</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0707026706,<span style="color:white">0.889403128</span>,0.0398942085999999]</span> . Why? well first off, <span style="color:orange">some students may have a hard time just keeping there grades to a c average.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0677868,<span style="color:white">0.8840666340000001</span>,0.0481465676]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They may have a c average but at least there passing, right?</br></br>As a student I love to play sports such as softball, but it can some times be hard for me to keep my grades up but if I had to get a b average in be more difficult for me to try to achieve it that. It can be hard to play something I love and have to keep my grades up at the same time.</br></br>I am awake 15 hours a day and more than have of that time is at school, and, while I go to school it takes up more time that I would have to study but instead of being able to study I have to learn more things.</br></br>If the students have to get a b average but aren't able to it will stop them from doing something they love. Students could try to make time to study but it could be very hard too.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.23139111,<span style="color:white">0.603622292</span>,0.1649866133999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Now you see why you shouldn't change the average levels. It could make a huge difference in the students and there love for the school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.471885244</span>,0.522335224,0.00577949752]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
