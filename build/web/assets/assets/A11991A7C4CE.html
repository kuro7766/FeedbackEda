Dear Mr. Senator,</br></br>Although it seems irrelevant and unnessary, <span style="color:orange">the Electoral College is very helpful and is needed more than people think.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The Electoral College is helpful in three ways:</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  one; <span style="color:orange">there is a certainty of outcome in the votes,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  two; <span style="color:orange">two types of states to persuade,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and three; <span style="color:orange">helpful to avoid run-off elctions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electoral College helps keep the certainty of outcome in the votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">"The Electoral College is widly regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the canadidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."</br></br>source three:</br></br>In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Elctoral College also gives the candidates a second chance at winning the election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Although someone won the popular vote portion of the election, they [the canidate] could still lose the election at the electoral portion. The electoral portion of the election is where the elected representatives go and vote for the president again and have a final deciding vote. Even with this prestegous process sometimes there are instenses were the "underdog" wins the electoral votes and</br></br>NOT</br></br>the popular votes. Although these instenses are little to non-exsitent.</br></br>"But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that is rarely betrayed)... [;however,] it is entirely possible that the winer of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that as happened very rarley. It happened in2000, when Gore had more popukar votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888."</br></br>source three:</br></br>In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">With two types of states, swing states and big states, the candidate can get wrapped up in trying to get the most votes in one particular type of state,-typically big states- they dont notice how the oppisite type of state could benefit them in the long run.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">"The winner take-all-method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates - as we saw in [2012's] election - to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states..."</br></br>"They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will recieve the most information and attention from the candidates0, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election."</br></br>source three:</br></br>In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner</br></br>On the other side of this arguement would be the big states (Texas, Califrnia, Florida, etc.) who usally vote the same party every election.</br></br>"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balnce that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mak-apportionmentof the Senate decreed in the Consitution..."</br></br>"So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential campiagns than a small state does..."</br></br>source three:</br></br>In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A.

Prsonally, this is the only logical solution to our nation's voting system.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sinceraly,</br></br>A concerned citizen
