Dear state senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">You seriously need to change this whole "Electoral College" voting system. It's not right and not accurate. Wouldn't it be fair if the people had a say in this? We..The People?</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0287494696,<span style="color:white">0.62367801</span>,0.347572512]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Popular vote definetly makes more sense in this case. It's proven that an electoral vote would sometimes end in a tie</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0433317426,<span style="color:white">0.76058485</span>,0.196083426]</span> , <span style="color:orange">resulting in a "You're President, You're Vice President" scenario. No one wants to go through a tie cause the election would go to the House of Representatives and then they would decide who is who. That's pretty stupid...if I do say so myself.</br></br>Now if the people, us, had a say in this...Then we'd defiently have a winner. No ties, No mistakes, No nothing. Just a plain, clean winner.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1754143899999999,<span style="color:white">0.72831285</span>,0.0962727579999999]</span>  <span style="color:white">The electoral college is unfair to voters to be honest.
