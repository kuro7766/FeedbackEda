Dear state senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">You seriously need to change this whole "Electoral College" voting system. It's not right and not accurate. Wouldn't it be fair if the people had a say in this? We..The People?</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Popular vote definetly makes more sense in this case. It's proven that an electoral vote would sometimes end in a tie</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">resulting in a "You're President, You're Vice President" scenario. No one wants to go through a tie cause the election would go to the House of Representatives and then they would decide who is who. That's pretty stupid...if I do say so myself.</br></br>Now if the people, us, had a say in this...Then we'd defiently have a winner. No ties, No mistakes, No nothing. Just a plain, clean winner.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">The electoral college is unfair to voters to be honest. The electoral college is irrational, unfair, outdated and annoying.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">No one uses it anymore. Due to it being completely unfair to citizens and states alike.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electoral College rule says "It requires a presidential canidate to trans-regianl appeal."</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Don't you think we know that? Then there's the fact that only "Big States" have a say, what about the smaller ones? There are people there too you know.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electoral College does avoid the problem of "Run-Off Elections"</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but that doesn't help the fact that we should all have a say.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Well, Nevertheless, you can understand why im so fed up with this "Electoral College" nonsense. It's stupid, outdated, and unfair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
