<span style="color:yellow">Now the fact is that the electoral college works well for our country, but when the population that is voting for president is actually voting for a candidate to vote for their state, that is lying to the voters and is morally wrong. We cannot lie to the population and be a strong country at the same time. We want to vote for our country's leaders not have someone else vote for us.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0326755652,0.383440572,<span style="color:white">0.583883846</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">We have gone on long enough with the electoral college, it is outdated and inefficient.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0333465184,0.573948546,<span style="color:white">0.392704956</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It dooes work to keep complications from arising in our voting procedures none the less.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.1426847128,<span style="color:white">0.7357395519999999</span>,0.1215757346]</span>  <span style="color:orange">And I will admit regional preferance is also a huge problem.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.153709023,<span style="color:white">0.73936228</span>,0.1069286975999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">What if the Presiident ignores a certain region of the country in crisis?
