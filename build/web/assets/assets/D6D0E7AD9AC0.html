<span style="color:yellow">Mr. Senator, the United States should keep the Electoral College process.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">This process makes sure that there will be a winner.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">It also makes sure that a candidate doesn't have a regional appeal.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The Electoral College process is certain that there will be a winner.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There are 538 electors.</br></br>A tie is possible just because 538 is an even number; most likely it will never happen. The big states get more electoral votes than the small states therefore if a presidential candidate gets the attention of most big states he has a higher chance of being elected. This process avoids run-off elections.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  There will be a certain winner.</br></br><span style="color:yellow">The candidates have no regional appeal using this process.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">If a candidate has a regional appeal they are not likely to win. No region (South, North, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. For example Romney was in the South and the South has no incentive to campaign, so he gets no electoral votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Despite the Electoral College having some problems, if we get a new process it will possibly have more problems and will be more difficult to control</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> .
