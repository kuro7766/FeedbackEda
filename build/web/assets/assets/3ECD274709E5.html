Dear principal:</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe that we should be aloud to have phones during lunch because well people have them out anyway.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Were also kids we love to text and sometimes talk to our parents or grandparents or someone like that. Some students may also be shy to talk to the people who go to our school. Its just something that takes some time to find out</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I also agree that we shouldn't because well harassment could go on or people could tell there friends to bring a gun or something to school or even drugs.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Yea it is fun to have our phones out but we don't need to focus our lives on phones some people around the countrys aren't lucky enough to have phones.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I say people shouldn't waist there time on phones get out and do something.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There are allot of people who cant move a bone in there body we should be thankful we can. God gave us gifts one of my gifts is softball and gymnastics those sports i love doing but you cant do them with a phone in your hand. well you could but it would be hard of dangerous.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Phones have got ton me in trouble may many of times</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:white">One year i was playing softball worming up the pitchers arm for the game i didn't have any gear on not even a face mask to protect my face well my phone rang in my pocket and i was so exited to see what it was.
