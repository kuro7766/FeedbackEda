Because people don't get study the will be get poor. I'm agree with this school they deside good idea for the village peoples. The learning is don't finish because will leaning every day some thing new. Study can't be finished when you will be die. Also, they need to do how the students teach to them and how they are learning.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.25541311,<span style="color:white">0.7400353580000001</span>,0.00455153564]</span>
