And the author organized the facts really well by putting alot of facts in each paragraph and focusing on that and giving alot of information on that subject. In paragraph 4 it talks about how Venus is almost like the earth and how maybe one day they would like too visit. This is a huge thing cause if so we could have another planet of life</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.7297749259999999</span>,0.268394396,0.0018306839]</span> . <span style="color:white">So in conclusion i think this article was very well planned and had just the right amount of infomation for a average person too learn and know about.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.503452148</span>,0.494781354,0.00176649512]</span>
