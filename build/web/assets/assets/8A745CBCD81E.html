I do think <span style="color:orange">students can benefit from being able to attend classes from home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0633308246,<span style="color:white">0.923331888</span>,0.01333729212]</span>  My reasoning to why is because <span style="color:orange">students could learn better in the comfort of their own homes,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0659121888,<span style="color:white">0.919739258</span>,0.01434855746]</span>  <span style="color:orange">benefit from no distractions,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.074565966,<span style="color:white">0.911366566</span>,0.0140674392]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">attending online classes can help students with social differences.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0761696242,<span style="color:white">0.90760961</span>,0.0162207729]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Therefore being comfortable can help your work ethic.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1199889556,<span style="color:white">0.867196792</span>,0.01281425236]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When in the comfort of your own home it's better to study, read, and stay focused. For example around students or an area your uncomfortable with can stop you from doing your best. But if you are in a environment that your more comfortable with you can work better. When your comfortable you learn better.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0907035467999999,<span style="color:white">0.89086843</span>,0.01842801812]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Secondly the ability to benefit from home with no distraction is more cable then being in a school setting with distraction.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.11071956</span>,0.8748452600000001,0.01443514672]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For example you can choose where and when to learn in your home with no distraction at all. But in school the options are scares. When a student is surrounded by a lot of other students and staff the drive to stay focus can be limited. There also could be students who stop classes from learning by being very distracting tends to being at home with no distraction at all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1087220499999999,<span style="color:white">0.8708658799999999</span>,0.02041206604]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In addition attending online classes could help students with social differences.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0697155636,<span style="color:white">0.91241288</span>,0.0178715511]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Sometimes students may have a problems speaking up or asking a question when confused because the pace of the class is way to fast. For example students with social differences can have trouble communicating in uncomfortable places. They can even have a panic attack when put on the spot to answer a question or present in front of the class. Instead taking online classes would really benefit. You wouldn't even have to worry about these things.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0722739,<span style="color:white">0.89187647</span>,0.035849635]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion I do think attending classes from home can benefit a student. For the same reason as students learning better in the comfort of their homes, having no distractions, and the fact that it can help a student with social differences. I believe attending classes from home can help in many different ways such as the ones that I included in my statement today. Thanks for reading and hearing my position on this issue.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0660175381999999,<span style="color:white">0.90575852</span>,0.0282239568799999]</span> </br></br>Generic_Name
