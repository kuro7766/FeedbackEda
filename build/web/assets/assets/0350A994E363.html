Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">This brief letter is to show you my perspective on changing from the Electoral College to changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.097853185,<span style="color:white">0.779559416</span>,0.122587402]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I believe that the Electoral College should be changed</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0501391644,<span style="color:white">0.799081398</span>,0.15077944]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">it's outdated,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0812080996,<span style="color:white">0.8156719060000001</span>,0.1031199648]</span>  <span style="color:orange">is very unfair,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1244062159999999,<span style="color:white">0.798950884</span>,0.0766429044]</span>  and <span style="color:white">is very misguiding</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1699125979999999</span>,0.755845276,0.0742421182]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electoral College should be changed because of how outdated it is.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0400202972,<span style="color:white">0.77899789</span>,0.180981814]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The United States is just calling for an update. And a productive and benificial update. Just like the update of IOS 7 that the Apple company has recently made. The Electoral College is just not as productive as it used to be. This is because of issues such as population increase. Since there's more people the electoral votes are more prone to getting miscounted or may lead to other problems.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1336355284,<span style="color:white">0.743157848</span>,0.1232066352]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Not only is the Electoral College outdated, however, it's also causes way to many dillemas. Thankfully this only haopens every four years so we get a break from hearing about all the troubles the Electoral College has done.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.347506746,<span style="color:white">0.6185601000000001</span>,0.0339331434]</span>  For instance, <span style="color:orange">the Electoral college is so unfair to voters because voters aren't even able to vote for thier candidate they have their electors vote for them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0324142331999999,<span style="color:white">0.6685074999999999</span>,0.299078296]</span>  Therefore, <span style="color:yellow">even though this happens on very rare occasions the electors have the power to vote for whoever they might choose. Which also causes stress on the voters, this is due to the unconfirmed assumption that they might not be voting for who they claim to be.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.142476612,0.764351746,<span style="color:white">0.093171664</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Aswell as the Electoral College being outdated, and unfair it's also irrational.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0756775176,<span style="color:white">0.7281310280000001</span>,0.196191447]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Direct voting instead of using the outdated, unfair Electoral College voting would be a great update to the United States.
