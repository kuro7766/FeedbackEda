<span style="color:orange">In 1976 Viking fly to Mars, and when they orbit/circle the mars they see a big head that look like pharoah head.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I think that the head was form by itself when the heat from Mars rise and it burn some of the rock and form the big head.

"There was no alien monument after all". So, the head was created by landform and if there were alien they would have seen them or take a photo of them but there was none so it was created by landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, the head that was on Mars was actually created by landform, not by alien because if it was created by alien then they would have seen them when they orbit the Mars and also it is not alien monument it is actually the "Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west".</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
