Dear Mr. Sentaor, Personaly <span style="color:orange">I believe we should keep the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Because it would be better for our country</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">The Electoral College is a process. This process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice presient. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is require to elect the president. Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I am aware that the Electoral College has some flaws</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">but nothings ever gonna be just the way you want right?</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Under the electoral college system, votetrs vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Also the electoral college is unfair to voters. It is unfair becuase of the winner-take-all system in each state. Candidates dont go to states they know there not going to win in. The Electoral College is outdated and irrational. But the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">In addition there are also good things about this electoral system.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For Example, the Electoral College resotres some of the weight in the politcial balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recevies a majority of the vostes cast</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">Furthermore, The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state Democrats</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">But of Course no voter's vote swings a national election American population did vote in 2012 election</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion these are the resons why I believe that we should keep the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
