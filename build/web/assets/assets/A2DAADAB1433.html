A lot of times, am I correct? Of Course I am around about 10% of drivers use their phone while driving, during the holiday that number increase a whole 15%</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2123674499999999,<span style="color:white">0.778137952</span>,0.00949460248]</span> . <span style="color:orange">About 26% of accidents are caused by people using their phones while being behind the wheel.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0513143906,<span style="color:white">0.91655307</span>,0.0321325406]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In the state of Georgia there is a law called the hands free law.

And it isn't just Georgia there is so many other states that have it to. So we all know if the government has a law on it its a real problem. If caught breaking this law you can be written a ticket 50 dollars or more depending if its is your first offence or not.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.307069108,<span style="color:white">0.68595883</span>,0.00697207258]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Now there are some moments when you just have to use your phone.

It is a distraction. It is one of the leading causes for car accidents. It is also a very expensive ticket so I encourage drivers to stay away from their phones while driving. Unless you absolutely need to use it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0396735942,<span style="color:white">0.932197168</span>,0.0281292234]</span> </br></br>1
