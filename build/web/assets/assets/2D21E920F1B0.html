<span style="color:orange">I entered a program before called the seagoing cowboys how it all started though was because of my friend don reist. I was working two part time jobs at a grocery store and a bank and when my friend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat.</br></br>I got to travel a lot to.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  So here is why <span style="color:orange">I am asking you to join the program just like I did.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br>I know you probaby won't do it but I am just going to try my best to convince you so the first reason is since the <span style="color:white">(UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys to take care of the horses,youngcows,and mules that were shipped overseas.)</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">That means you would get to help out other countries and their disasters.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  Another reason you should join is because <span style="color:orange">you get to travel all kinds of places in the world</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  ( <span style="color:orange">Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.
