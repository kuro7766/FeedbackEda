Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere." That is a description of the air and sky of Venus, now I will give a description of the surface of Venus. "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our own planet."

The author seems to support the idea of studying Venus really well, but I don't think that we know enough about the planet to determine whether going is in our best interest.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1741931179999999,<span style="color:white">0.7406075</span>,0.0851993854]</span>
