Employers aren't usually looking for candidates that show up late to interviews or employees who show up late to work every day. Not being punctual can not only hurt people in their professional lives, but also in their personal lives. Friends, family members, and significant others are going to want to invite their loved one to breakfasts, lunches, parties, and more and are going to be upset and angry when they show up late or not at all, which could end up with that person losing a lot of people whom they care about</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0033933860599999,0.1074934482,<span style="color:white">0.8891132020000001</span>]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Compromise is a skill that is required in the real world because no one gets everything that they want and when there are arguments or disputes the only way to solve them is to compromise.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0135927895999999,<span style="color:white">0.3560974739999999</span>,0.630309752]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This is another skill that is very frequently learned in public schools due to the amount of students and how different they are, it is also something that online school curriculum lacks because it is a commonly practiced behavior.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.00437945522,<span style="color:white">0.192605593</span>,0.803014968]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Often times, people who are homeschooled lack social skills, not all but as a generalization.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0260898555799999,<span style="color:white">0.335589664</span>,0.6383204539999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Many public schools offer organizations and clubs such as DECCA or FCCLA for students to learn business, public speaking and organizational skills.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.01423348336,<span style="color:white">0.380719892</span>,0.6050466379999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It is true that online students most likely would be able to join these programs</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.02781948754,<span style="color:white">0.473344216</span>,0.498836314]</span> , <span style="color:orange">but it would be more difficult for them as the programs are based on school activities and organized around the school schedule.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.00921728368,<span style="color:white">0.3070196839999999</span>,0.683763042]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">People who attend online school may feel like outsiders in these groups of students of which all go to the same public school.

Online students may experience a type of culture shock when they go to college or enter the workforce and meet a person who is a different race than them, someone with a disibility, a person on the autism spectrum, or even a person who practices a different religion than they do. This is a sensation unknown to most public school students because of how they are exposed to many different and diverse groups of people at a young age. This type of culture shock could cause problems for these online students in our increasingly open-minded and progressive world.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00300582164,0.089394488,<span style="color:white">0.907599682</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">One of the apparent reasons that students attend online school is to escape bullying</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0270540203,<span style="color:white">0.472566798</span>,0.500379178]</span> . <span style="color:white">Statistically, bullying has reduced significantly in the past 30 years, yet these are the years when online school was introduced.
