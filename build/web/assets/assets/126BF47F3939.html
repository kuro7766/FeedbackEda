For instance better facial recognition security systems so it can be more accurate reading faces and does not open or let in anyone that looks like the person. Or lock the person out of anything that is protected by facial recognition. Another example of how this could be useful in other ways is the facial recognition can be used in the police force to find a match of a person that was caught on camera to be tracked down and captured.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The way that the researchers are using it for is inefficient and wasteful and should not be implemented in classrooms.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
