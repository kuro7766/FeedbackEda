To fix this problem states have inflicted heavier laws, for example Georgia has the no hands law and that means you can't have any hands on your phone at all, not even calls can be answered. Texting while driving is such a bad choice because it can cause you to swerve off road or swerve into someone's car. It's a bad habit in today's society and it needs to be stopped.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0997204798,<span style="color:white">0.8175029840000001</span>,0.082776524]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion texting and driving is all out bad, and needs to be stopped, there needs to be classes and more lessons taught on the effects of texting and driving.
