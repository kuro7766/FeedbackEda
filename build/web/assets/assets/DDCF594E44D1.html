Dear Mr. Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">The peope of American should let their voice be heard. Why should we rely on the electoral college to pick our prisendent? In fact if you're going to rely on the electoral college to pick our next president why let civilized American citizens vote?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I would say it is time for a change and let the American people's voice be heard.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">It seems as if the passage is more in favor of elections based on the electoral college votes. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. At the most basic level,the electoral college is unfair to voters because it's a winners takes all system. The electoral colllege consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect your president. The elctoral college is anachronism and it's time we should be open minded and look in to the future and rely on the Americans votes we should not rely on 538 people to vote for the millions of people we have in America. Even if we had a combination of  the popular vote with elctoral college that would make it more fair than just having the electoral college pick the president they want in office.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Instead of relying on this piece of history lets rely on bring cheap clothes,food,and gas prices back.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
