<span style="color:yellow">During summer break, many students are busy on vacation or are preoccupied with other activities. Because of this, students are not reinforcing what they have previously learned or preparing for the upcoming school year. Summer projects are an efficient way to get students familiar with and exposed to concepts they will learn in school and bolster their knowledge. However, the decision of making summer projects either teacher-designed or student-designed creates a debate of the effectiveness of both types of projects.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.00497143242,0.1744374719999999,<span style="color:white">0.8205910679999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Summer projects should be teacher-designed</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0524816324,<span style="color:white">0.6234889299999999</span>,0.3240294449999999]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">as teachers are more knowledgeable with the curriculum which will allow them to prepare an assignment that is more effective for the student,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0030054976599999,0.218526004,<span style="color:white">0.77846848</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">teacher-assigned projects will provide a guide for what the students will or should learn</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00496846314,0.292095316,<span style="color:white">0.7029362120000001</span>]</span> , and <span style="color:yellow">students will most likely feel more prepared for school with an assignment created by the teacher.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00476933254,0.283793104,<span style="color:white">0.7114375780000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Since teachers know more about the subject they teach more than the students, having teachers create their own assignment for their students will be more effective</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0037252826,0.252312646,<span style="color:white">0.743962062</span>]</span> . <span style="color:orange">They know what the students need to learn based on the curriculum, so it is ideal for them to decide what they should study over the break.
