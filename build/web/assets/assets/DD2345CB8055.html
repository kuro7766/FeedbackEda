Dear mr. senator, <span style="color:orange">i think that we should keep the electorial college,</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because  it is more sufficient and we are used to it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  when i say this, i am speaking for the people. The Electorial college is a process, not a place. <span style="color:orange">The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise Between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">COMPROMISE</br></br>is the big word of the day. Most compromises are the right way to go in many occasions. also, it says that it was in THE CONSTITUTION</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>.</br></br><span style="color:orange">Our founding fathers have already had this argument hundreds of years ago, and they agreed on something that has worked for many years, so why would we changte something thats working?</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  you are insane if you want to change it mister senator. <span style="color:white">The elecotrial College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electorial votes by congress.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <--- great process btw! <span style="color:white">The electorial college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorial votes is required to elect the president. Your states entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation : one for each member in the House of representitives plus two for your senators.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>HMU if you wanna dicuss this any further</br></br>EMAIL_ADDRESS</br></br>from:PROPER_NAME
