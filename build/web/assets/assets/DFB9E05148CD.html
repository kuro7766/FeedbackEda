Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Students should be able to do community service,</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0296527603999999,<span style="color:white">0.5185695960000001</span>,0.4517776599999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">its great for the community and their moral caricature.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.022763566,<span style="color:white">0.4267945419999999</span>,0.550441886]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">for example say someone wishes to clean up the trash polluting the community and the land around it in this case the service is needed its good for the community, the school, and the wild-life. Or if their going to help out at a shelter or a church, the service is needed greatly for the homeless, animals, and elderly. And the school which is part of the community should help with donations, food drives, and clothing banks. community service is greatly needed everywhere, since others cant do it by themselves its best to give are neighbors a had every once in a while. That's why we need community service its good for the community and school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0059804403,0.0712954406,<span style="color:white">0.92272413</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">And if we didn't have community service then the community would be devastated.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.018183282,0.369168202,<span style="color:white">0.612648514</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Trash would clutter lots, homeless people and animals would have nowhere to go and the elderly wouldn't get the assistance they need like when some one walks them down the street. or helps them up or down stairs. with out the community's help many people and animals would suffer or go with out. And that could hurt a community very badly. And it pains most students to see these poor people and innocent animals suffer or have to live in such filthy conditions. that's why we ask for community service it makes the community and are self's feel better. So why don't you allow the children who want to help, help.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01249311166,0.126617278,<span style="color:white">0.8608896400000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">and those who don't give it to them as a punishment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0525145208,0.48008025,<span style="color:white">0.467405252</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">detention wont teach them their lesson but a couple of hours picking up trash will.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.1020058804,0.5839594,<span style="color:white">0.314034742</span>]</span> </br></br>so please take it into consideration the community needs the help and students are willing to give it.</br></br>sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
