Dear, State Senator</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think we should keep the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Even though it is despised method of choosing our nation leader, it is the best form of desiding who will run and the winner.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding father established it in the Constitution as a compromise between elections ot the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting for the electors wherer they vote for the President and the Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that we should keep the Electoral College for five reasons. Number one,</br></br>Certainty of Outcome</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">. Which is a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  Number two,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Everyone's president</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  . <span style="color:orange">Which is the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  Number three,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Swing States</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  . The <span style="color:orange">Swing States</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  is a winner-takes-all method of awarding electoral votes incluces the canidates. Number four,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Big States</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  . The <span style="color:orange">Big States</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  is the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the politcal balance that the large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. Last but not least is number five,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Avoid Run-Off Elections</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">. Avoiding Run-Off Elections is when the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The Elecoral College is not all that fair though because it is an anachronism, a non-democtratic method of selecting a president the ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think we should keep the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Even though it is despised method of choosing our nation leader, it is the best form of desiding who will run and the winner.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  But it is the way our founding fathers made this nation and wanted it to stay that way because they created it that way.</br></br>From,</br></br>Austin
