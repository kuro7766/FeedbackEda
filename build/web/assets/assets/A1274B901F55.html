Dear, Principal</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think students should have to do community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0883612793999999,<span style="color:white">0.846700624</span>,0.0649381308]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because if they want the points to go to the next grade or school they need to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.21967576,<span style="color:white">0.75727118</span>,0.0230530566]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For me community service is a good way to show kids how to work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0781653964,<span style="color:white">0.8482388860000001</span>,0.0735957166]</span>  <span style="color:white">I think the required time for community service is twenty-four hours. I think that community service can be done anywhere even in fast food restaurants such as Burger King, McDonald's, Wendy's, or KFC, and all the other fat food restaurants, but the point is not about fast food restaurants, the point is that i think that community service could be done anywhere if they let you.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.4903429600000001</span>,0.48328654,0.02637048586]</span>  <span style="color:white">If you want kids to have to do community service then they should do it and if they don't want to then that's their problem because they have to earn the hours and the points, and if you don't want to make us take community service then we have to make up for it in high school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.22397049</span>,0.676635848,0.0993936516]</span>  <span style="color:white">I have not yet done my community service because i haven't had time to do it but i am planning to do it in these next few months, but my problem is that i don't know what i should do to gain the points. I was thinking i should do my community service, and get the required points at .... well like i said i don't really know where i am going to do it, but ill think about it really hard, but my goal is when i do find out what i am going to do i am going to get the points and hours in a week and a half or less.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.54195601</span>,0.42707052,0.0309734427999999]</span> </br></br>From, STUDENT_NAME
