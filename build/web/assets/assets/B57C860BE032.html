<span style="color:orange">I will be trying to convince the population to beleive that the face's on Mars are natural landforms.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Now i will be talking about face one. this face is there in 1976. To my personal vision the face is still sorte of developing, or the picture is really blury. Although it's developing or blury you can still seea face. NASA claim's for it to look or be visualized as a viking.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">These face's do look like natural landforf's.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">They look like wind or a storm formed them. In face one it look's like there is alot of wind when NASA took the picture. In face two it kinda revels a little more . What im thinking is there had to have been a storm or strong wind for face one to be so blury.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">These face's seem as if they had alot of time to form. Can that mean there natural.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Think about this if these structure's were man made or alein made they wouldn't look like this</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">so what is that telling us. Another reason is if it was man made it would be much smaller. These faces have to be natural landforms. Also to my understanding NASA has been watching the faces for a while.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Then in picture three it is just totaly blown over. It seem's as if wind just keept blowing over then time and time agian.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">If it was man made this would not have happend they would have kept it clean.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Although this is my oppinion many other's agree with what im am trying to argue. I also agree that these are natural land form's and are soon going to be wiped away.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
