To my personal vision the face is still sorte of developing, or the picture is really blury. Although it's developing or blury you can still seea face. NASA claim's for it to look or be visualized as a viking.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.47258461,<span style="color:white">0.524920986</span>,0.0024944241399999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">These face's do look like natural landforf's.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.118124342,<span style="color:white">0.8761898160000001</span>,0.0056858515199999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">They look like wind or a storm formed them. In face one it look's like there is alot of wind when NASA took the picture. In face two it kinda revels a little more . What im thinking is there had to have been a storm or strong wind for face one to be so blury.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2085595199999999,<span style="color:white">0.7853431</span>,0.0060973988799999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">These face's seem as if they had alot of time to form.

Another reason is if it was man made it would be much smaller. These faces have to be natural landforms. Also to my understanding NASA has been watching the faces for a while.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.4029157400000001</span>,0.594579242,0.00250502614]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Then in picture three it is just totaly blown over.
