Dear Mr. Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">The citizens of your state are crying injustice, but nothing is being done to serve them. The Electoral College goes against the Bill of Rights opening words of "We the People". The current system of electing the President is more complex and less beneficial than choosing our leader through popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0144378876599999,<span style="color:white">0.291449624</span>,0.6941125020000001]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The popular vote actually listens to the people of the United States' opinion and how they want this country run.
