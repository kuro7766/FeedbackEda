Dear principal,</br></br><span style="color:white">I would like to put my opinion about students being required to perform community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.3520271419999999</span>,0.624759478,0.023213388]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe community service would have good looks on to our schools.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0354163614,<span style="color:white">0.7605328840000001</span>,0.204050758]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also it would make our students look like they want to help and change the world</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.038534344,<span style="color:white">0.78053474</span>,0.180930908]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Actually make it a better place for the children that live in the area.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0546292526,<span style="color:white">0.7907037060000001</span>,0.154667024]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Community service can help the students that are in high school get into colleges.

I think community services would actually be a wonderful success. <span style="color:yellow">To the older people the younger people may take out the trash for them, mow their lawns, etc. If that would happen this world would be an better place. A place where everyone would get along and peaceful.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0739193524,0.765404396,<span style="color:white">0.160676274</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also the students would actually be communicating wit each other</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0993246954,<span style="color:white">0.806313632</span>,0.0943616706]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Having fun, making new friends would be amazing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.257326582,<span style="color:white">0.7182032319999999</span>,0.0244702186]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The only thing that may be wrong about it is the whole work time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.2560641279999999,<span style="color:white">0.7040776120000001</span>,0.0398582599999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">You have to know how to manage to keep your grades up and be able to perform in community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.1134137978,<span style="color:white">0.785240252</span>,0.1013459248]</span>  But <span style="color:orange">I strongly believe community service should be required for elementary school students and up</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1495048487999999,<span style="color:white">0.8209901580000001</span>,0.0295049995999999]</span> .
