Mr. goldberg also stated "how much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid" which is also something that is not taken into account.</br></br>In paris there had a offical ban from drving your cars, people who were caught driving cars were fined up to 22-euro($31).Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emisssions. Caris typically has more smog than other european capitals with paris having up to 147 micro grams of particulate matter (pm) per cubic meter compared with 114 in brussels and 79.7 in london, reuters found. Congestion was down 60% after just five-days of intensifying smog which even rivaled places such beijing and china.</br></br>Suburbs and cities are very wide leading to one of the main reasons for motored-vechile. But there have been efforts in the last two decades to make cities denser which have lead to greatly less car usasge. Places like vauban,home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile.

But places such as paris have been finally trying to make a differences and put a partial ban on cars. and one of the best ways could be to make cities and suburbs more compact.
