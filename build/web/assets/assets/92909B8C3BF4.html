Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closet in distance too. He also discribed the plant as a cloud-draped world, and says maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched downn on venus in more than three decades</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.5961380459999999,<span style="color:white">0.400827824</span>,0.0030341448999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The author also gets into some math into this by breaking down some percentages that venus has compared to other plants by saying. "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus ". he also says that one the plants surface , temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and theatmosphere pressure is 90 times gretaer than what they have experienced on earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.341781122,<span style="color:white">0.6528877399999999</span>,0.0053311263999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Venus has the hottest surface tempertature of many plants in our solar system, even with mercury being closer to the sun.

Also at thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but tha air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.377390794,<span style="color:white">0.618759238</span>,0.00384994578]</span>
