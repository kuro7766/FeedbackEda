Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I know as well as anyone else that sports are important in a child's life. Some students are incredibly gifted at sports, but others may not be. However, sports are a privilege, not a right.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.00771665788,0.219080462,<span style="color:white">0.7732029039999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Many schools have a policy that students must obtain at least a D average which is barely passing. I don't think that this should be so. Although I don't think that the policy at our school should be changed to obtaining a B average either.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.00471616832,0.160322024,<span style="color:white">0.8349618360000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Many students excel at sports while others at schooling. Although there are some students that exceed in both of these fields, obtaining a B average is rather hard for some students, especially with being in a sport.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0026732829,0.1127195591999999,<span style="color:white">0.8846071500000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Sports require team practices which are very exhausting on the body and the mind. Sometimes, when students get home from these practices, they don't have the energy for much.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0189065031999999,0.36950189,<span style="color:white">0.611591602</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I know you are thinking that school is more important that sports, and most parents would agree with you,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.0312618965999999,0.453665844,<span style="color:white">0.5150722219999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">but without sports and exercise the childhood obesity level would skyrocket as it has in the last few years within adults.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Effective/0.0294901373999999,0.4091379460000001,<span style="color:white">0.561371896</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that changing the activity participation grade level to a B average is a little extreme. However, I don't think that it should stay at a D average. Student's should actually have to try in school to have the privilege of being in a sport, but at a D average they don't have to. The policy at our school should be changed but not to an extreme of a B average</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0170921242,<span style="color:white">0.353915362</span>,0.628992494]</span> . I thank you for your time and cooperation.
