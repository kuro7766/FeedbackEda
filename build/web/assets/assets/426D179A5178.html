All that can be very stressfull and make life even harder to live with, like in source 1 mother of two, Heidrun Walter talks about how "when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Her not having a car made her life way less stressfull and tense then before hand.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Another outcome of limiting car usage would be less pollution.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">All these fumes are not good for the planet we live on and deffintley not good for us human beings.
