Consulting different people will lead to tons of information on whether you are making the best choice. One example is that publishers make authors send their books to professional editors, editors advise the authors to add some of their ideas and fix any mistakes that are shown. This goes to show that having another person that will give helpful bits of information will help make a much better decision.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.001979442726,0.0992230588,<span style="color:white">0.8987974980000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Talking to more people and consulting with them for advice or an opinion leads to more ideas</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00261433603,0.157464904,<span style="color:white">0.839920766</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Based on what the other person says you can always make a decision on whether to input their ideas into yours or if you want to disregard their idea. For example when a student is about to hand in an assignment they always have someone peer review/edit to add ideas or tell them what they think needs to be fixed. Most students do this because they want to have someone else view and improve on their work. By inputting the other persons opinions and using the advice that was given the student will turn in the better version of the assignment than what the student was about to turn in beforehand.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.002495559446,0.0911440394,<span style="color:white">0.906360372</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">When you ask another person for advice or an opinion you get a new outlook and perspective each time</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.002098902814,0.136804061,<span style="color:white">0.86109704</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Each person views something differently. Having multiple view points is important if you want to see how each person inter pratesÂ what you are saying, and see whether you like the way they see it, or if you want to change it to be perceived in a different way. Something doctors do is they refer you to another doctor to get a second opinion. They do this because the other doctors may catch something that the original doctor did not catch the first time. This example goes to show that everyone has a different outlook on things and see things that some people may not see.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0035451112539999,0.1033524406,<span style="color:white">0.89310244</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">It is crucial to consult more than one person for their opinion or advice about something when you are looking for the best choice you could possibly make.
