And if they new it was gonna cause harm to the environment then why did they do it i mean that's pretty dumb. They new that them hazardous gasses and fumes were gonna mess things up so why would they do it.</br></br>But u have to have these vehicles and semis to be able to transport goods from place to place do i mean your really just gonna have to deal with it cause u have to have them cause whose gonna hall all that stuff by hand one by one nobody and its just a waste of time cause u would kill yourself trying to do it so why not just use a semi that uses left over stuff from gas that way there not dumping all that stuff out on the ground ans its not going down and pouluting our water let it puluote our air but if we don't have that water we couldnt go 3 days and we could were gas masks if it come down to it its really not that big of a deal.</br></br>There making this how smog thing a big deal they can come up with something to help that or go away that is just so stupid that they do that cause they can prevent some of it with safe idle and emmisind but they dont want to hold to there laws ad people that are doing it they just let them go on like there doing and they do nothing about.
