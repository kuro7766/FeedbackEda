Social anxiety is an illness and affects most people one way or another. Social anxiety can prevent someone from doing the simplest of things. Things that even a mere child could do.

If they're drunk, they could even fall asleep amd end up all the way across the country because they never told the car when to stop driving. Even when the operator of the car isn't drunk that could happen. Since there's no laws against it, they could just fall asleep while driving and cause accidents. If they think its okey to sleep, they will cirtainly think that texting, getting on social media, and watching videos is okay. They'll stop paying attention to the road, and could get seriously hurt.
