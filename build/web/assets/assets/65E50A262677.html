To Principle:</br></br><span style="color:yellow">Community service is something people do voluntary, not something that should be required.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0085648742799999,0.310021226,<span style="color:white">0.68141392</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Students have other things to worry about such as studying,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00753229512,0.299889392,<span style="color:white">0.692578304</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">homework,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0189466081399999,0.3732122479999999,<span style="color:white">0.6078411559999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">chores</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0187631618,0.37188056,<span style="color:white">0.6093562859999999</span>]</span>  etc. <span style="color:orange">There is already a lot of adults who volunteer for community service, and there's people who by law are forced to. Kids on the other hand shouldn't have to. Students don't need something else on their shoulders, school is for learning and nothing else.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0149339679399999,<span style="color:white">0.311357928</span>,0.673708074]</span> </br></br>Students have to study no matter what. Community service is like an obstacle that prevents kids to actually study. <span style="color:yellow">Already there is many students who don't study at all, and making all students do community service would discourage the small percentage who do. Doing things like cleaning and taking care of younger kids can be tiring. Even adults get tired of doing these things, imagine how a minor would feel. When a student is tired and has the choice to study or not they would most likely rather not; well after so much work they have just done. Not studying can lower test scores, and not to mention lower student grades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0035170761599999,0.1085290006,<span style="color:white">0.887953924</span>]</span> </br></br>As studying weren't enough of an issue, with all this community service where can a student find time to do their homework? <span style="color:orange">Of course, those who choose to volunteer for community service find their way; they figure out their own schedule.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0135520455399999,<span style="color:white">0.312626744</span>,0.6738212079999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But what about those new goer's?

When you have such a tight schedule (which can be harder to those who play sports or clubs) your only option is to do your homework at night. Which is really bad because students end up having less hours of sleep, which is required for a good healthy day. Homework should be done right after school, but with this new task it wouldn't be possible.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0066848593399999,0.166872684,<span style="color:white">0.826442478</span>]</span> </br></br>What about certain <span style="color:yellow">chores</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0187631618,0.37188056,<span style="color:white">0.6093562859999999</span>]</span>  students have to do at home?
