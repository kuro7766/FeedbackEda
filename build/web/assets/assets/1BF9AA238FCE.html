<span style="color:yellow">W.E.B DuBois, the influential civil rights activist and co founder of the NAACP, valued education and believed that it was the most important thing in life. However, most students do not share the same beliefs nowadays. They dread going to school because they have to wake up early and rush to get to school on time. They wish to wake up on their own and get the day going at their own pace. When a student has to rush to shcool against theirt will, it can increase stress and reduce productivity. This can be a huge obstacle in the path of their education. Some schools offer distance learning, which allows students to take classes at home through online or video conferencing</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.001509463308,0.0798187948,<span style="color:white">0.918671754</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Taking classes online and at home is extremely beneficial for a student's learning</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0128114206399999,0.469949286,<span style="color:white">0.517239312</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because it can help avoid illness</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.00397017438,<span style="color:white">0.281303728</span>,0.7147261479999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">and it is a more comfortable environment, thus increasing productivity.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0030322746799999,<span style="color:white">0.233458744</span>,0.7635089799999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">However, it is likely that students will take advantage of this feature in a negative way. The lack of commitment to the online learning can decrease their will to learn. They can skip class and not get anything done at home.

Yet, these factors play a crucial role in the student's development as a person. They teach the student discipline and time management. When a student skips an online class, the teacher will be able to know and punish them accordingly, whether it is lowering their grade or contacting their parents. This teaches the student not to skip classes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Effective/0.00192804748,0.1217941179999999,<span style="color:white">0.876277834</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Technology issues are unpredictable but are not a complete obstruction to the student's learning.

This can be avoided by introducing distance learning. A huge and current example of this is COVAD-19, the coronavirus. It is massive pandemic that is shocking everyone around the world. There are thousands of deaths and cases worldwide. School systems, such as Generic_School Counties, are discussing the possibility of closing school and shifting classes to online to prevent the transfer of this deadly disease.

Online classes are far less time consuming because you don't have to go anywhere. You can simply wake up, open your device, and start learning; whereas if you're going to school, you have to get ready, travel to school, and sit bored in class wishing to go home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0026331129139999,0.125512572,<span style="color:white">0.87185433</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Offering distance learning through online classes and video conferencing can help a lot in a student's path of education because it keeps them safe from breakout diseases and increases their productivity by making them more comfortable.
