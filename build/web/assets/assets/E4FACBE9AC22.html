I also think that kids that get in trouble shouldnt be allowed to because they didnt listen or did something they wasnt suppose to . Why give a kid this if they dont listen, they dont deserve to do something like this is they are being disrespectful or not listening. Students that do get good grades above a</br></br>D ad F and arent disrespectful should be able to do this if they wanted to.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.409293074</span>,0.5827140139999999,0.00799291068]</span>  The principle should let the kids decide if they want to participate in sports,work on the year book, or serve student council. <span style="color:orange">If students some students did this and some students didnt do this it would be easier on the teacher in that class because schools have a lot of kids, and if you was to split the whole school up into activities there is going to be 1 teacher and a lot of kids.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.130034261,<span style="color:white">0.8537980060000001</span>,0.0161677545]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Now yes you can put more than 1 teacher in the rooms but if you think about it teachers have to plan there classes and what they are going to do for the rest of the week , and some teachers dont have time because they have other things they need to do after school and in school. Like what if a teacher got sick the other teacher would be by its self with all those kids . Some kids should do this because they never have or never had experience with this type of stuff and some kids will try and take advantage to this and only do it to get out of doing other stuff, thats why i think this is not a good idea ,</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.36803036,<span style="color:white">0.618351752</span>,0.0136178941]</span>
