<span style="color:orange">On May 24,2001 NASA vikings 1 spacecraft was circling mars and snapped a photo of a strange human like face on mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It just so happens its not actually a face. Scientists discovered that the face on mars was just a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some people think aliens created the "face" on mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">However, aliens did not create the face on mars. The face was a natural landform, scientists did tons of research on this face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">At first the scientists thought the face on mars was just another Martian mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Once this face was captured on camera a few days later NASA revealed the face they took a picture of on mars. The face then was starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines and even radio talk shows.</br></br>When the scientists were researching the face on mars, like i said they thought it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Many people make ridiculous assuotions, like how they think aliens created this face on mars, even though there can be human life on mars but those are just theorys people are making. Which is when everyone starts amking these assuptions and even make it look belivable that aliens could have possible made the "face on mars".</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So aliens did not create this human like face on mars it was mostly just consquently mistaken to be one becuase it really is just huge rocks together just so happening to look like a face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
