Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:white">I strongly believe that community service is something good,</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.156674302</span>,0.7302397039999999,0.1130860068]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">that all the students should be willing to perform community service in some way.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0316877558,<span style="color:white">0.5590539640000001</span>,0.4092582919999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Community service teaches us many valuable things.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.04108658432,<span style="color:white">0.5933734800000001</span>,0.365539954]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">And it also gives us the opportunity to aid others that need it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0347480016,<span style="color:white">0.503901288</span>,0.4613506819999999]</span> </br></br>Community service is very important in many ways. <span style="color:orange">First, is a way of helping, and growing together as a community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.04749685328,<span style="color:white">0.5566423159999999</span>,0.395860836]</span> </br></br>Also, <span style="color:orange">we shouldn't expect someone else to do our job. We are the future of our community/country; and if we are growing up expecting we don't have to do anything, we will have very few chances of being successful.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1535348406,<span style="color:white">0.58360422</span>,0.2628608892]</span> </br></br>It is definitely not a waste of time.</br></br>We can do many things we like for community service.</br></br><span style="color:orange">Like if we like math, or are good at it, we could tutor those who need more help. Or if we are interested in justice, or working for peace, we could volunteer at places that do that kind of work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0483270122,<span style="color:white">0.5253143180000001</span>,0.4263586209999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Furthermore, community service doesn't have to be boring, we could take our friends, or siblings. Then they will learn from our example, we will have company, and our virtues will spread throughout our community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.093831591</span>,0.582082912,0.324085484]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Finding ways to perform community service is very easy; just talk to your parents, neighbors, classmates, etc. Something else is that it doesn't have to be the biggest thing ever. Small actions will lead to great achievements.</br></br>Doing small actions every day, sometimes without even planning, will help our community grow in many ways.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0892691442,<span style="color:white">0.532559006</span>,0.3781718699999999]</span> </br></br>We will also benefit from these actions. <span style="color:orange">When we need help we will know that our neighbor or classmate will be there to help us and will take care of us. When we are older, the younger kids we showed all those virtues, will keep passing them to their family, friends. Soon we will see all the great things we achieved.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1441495444999999,<span style="color:white">0.495929106</span>,0.359921368]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Please help us develop a great community, learn great things, and give us different</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.3480274539999999</span>,0.56716656,0.0848059967999999]</span>
