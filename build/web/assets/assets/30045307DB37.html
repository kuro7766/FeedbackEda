Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I am writing to you about the debate on the abolishment of the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.262640188,<span style="color:white">0.726757628</span>,0.0106021967]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I see absolutely no point in the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0794777438,<span style="color:white">0.8798481280000001</span>,0.0406741179999999]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">all it is is elected people from a state voting on the president based on what the popular vote for the president was in their assigned area.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1228465397999999,<span style="color:white">0.83352857</span>,0.0436248946]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electoral College has 538 electors. The majority of them are from the states of California, Texas, New York, and Florida. Election Day is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. I don't see why we need other people to vote for us. The Bill of Rights said that we have a "freedom of speech", but our "freedom of speech" is given to other people to change around.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.5383758860000001,<span style="color:white">0.4523538099999999</span>,0.00927031504]</span>  <span style="color:orange">We need to abolish the Electoral Congress so we can just vote for who we want!</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.089973008,<span style="color:white">0.866778146</span>,0.0432488676]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The popular vote means that the president who recieved more votes claims that the state voted more for him/her.

Obama decides to do whatever he wants. Insurance prices have gone up due to "ObamaCare", and now there is a huge, long, and exhausting process to get te see a specialist especially if you need to see one. It is out of control and he needs to do something about it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.5622811000000001</span>,0.4284300679999999,0.0092888188999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">We should abolish the Electoral College because its just a waste.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.094693479</span>,0.866638942,0.0386675916]</span>  <span style="color:white">All they do is tally up the popular vote, and say "OK, im going to vote for Romney since that's what my people want."Â  Why can't we just vote for who we want instead of wasting our time! The popular vote should be the only way to vote. There shouldn't be a long and hard process to voting. If I go and vote, I don't want to have to know like 60 different people to vote for, I just want to check the box saying that I want to vote for 'so and so' and leave and go home. It is ridiculous about having a whole process to voting.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.302489482</span>,0.6563098399999999,0.041200686]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I hope this letter made up your mind on to vote</br></br>YES</br></br>for abolishing the Electoral College. When I get older and can start voting, I hope that I can vote for whom ever I want without being told that " You just voted for nothing because the popular vote when to '(other Presidential Candidate)'and they won so they get the state.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.191185404,<span style="color:white">0.784692318</span>,0.0241222694]</span>
