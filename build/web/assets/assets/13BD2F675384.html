Dear Principle,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Allow students to have phones because students will want to use their cell phones during lunch and other free time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0445055772,<span style="color:white">0.928817488</span>,0.0266769156]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Students would agree and so do I, because no student wants to not use their phone all day long while they are at school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0722531768,<span style="color:white">0.90883186</span>,0.0189149502199999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The principle may agree or may not agree to this task, but students may not be as responsible at school with their phones out as they use them. Most of the students may agree so be more careful at school with their phones out during lunch or any other free time.

Cell phones to me should be allowed, but only if all students can be trusted. Each student will try their best to not use it during class sections, but only during lunch and other free time at school. Every student wants to use them during school hours and have the trust they are given to use them and be respectful not to steal other peoples cell phones when they are being used.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1501794388,<span style="color:white">0.829731222</span>,0.0200893449599999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Each and every student may have a phone and I'm sure that they all agree that not having and phones on campus is harsh and mean.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1513654507999999,<span style="color:white">0.83171182</span>,0.01692273134]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I will agree to this task and make sure that other students and not using them during class.
