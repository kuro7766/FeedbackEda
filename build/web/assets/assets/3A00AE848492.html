Since Mars is mostlikely cloudy, the photos were taken when Mars was cloudless and was in open in Cydonia. MGS had took enough pictures during those times when it cloudless. Pictures were taking for many reasons. One of the reasons was for taxpayers. Jim Garvin, a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, wanted this to happen for profit. But, some other reasons were to learn about Mars and it's surroundings for the next ship to travel there.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.374555782</span>,0.6140520740000001,0.01139211988]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It really wasn't build by aliens nor any other creature out in space.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0912949646,<span style="color:white">0.88709945</span>,0.0216055997999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The Face of Mars was made 25yrs ago.

Not everyone was satisfied since they wanted more proof for this. It was April '98, cloudy time of year on Mars, where people couldn't use their telescopes to see the Face for themselves. So, on April 8th, 2001, MGS gotten close enough for another look. They've took another picture using a better camera that could see anything clear like a airplane, a truck, or a Egyptian-style pyramids!
