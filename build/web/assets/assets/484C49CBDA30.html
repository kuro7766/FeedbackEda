You still are in control just that you choose somebody he/her is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that "Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candiate's politcal party." I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.105211429,0.342688064,<span style="color:white">0.5521004848</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">This does make the candiate running for president try to convience the electors he is the one they need and that he will help our country be better.
