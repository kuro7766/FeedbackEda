It feels like a movie like,maybe in the future who knows when, we might have to go to venus because of something that happen in earth. we are going to leave homes and everything we worked on and live a new life in another planet. It kinda reminds me of that movie ¨Wall-e¨ they left earth nasty and a lot of poultion and went to live in a spacecraft in space. I would not want to live like that because what if somthing happened in the spacecraft</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.7615488979999999</span>,0.236909692,0.0015413717239999]</span> . <span style="color:white">Back to what i was talking about, yea it would be cool to live in another planet, but those people that nasa is going to send out ton explore venus, have to explore it really carefully. I find it really interesting how there is a similar planet to earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.519647066</span>,0.478648964,0.0017039785499999]</span>
