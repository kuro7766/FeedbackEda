When they are on their campaign they visit states individual amd they spen alot of time on swing states or the big states such as California, Florida, and Texas. without the electoral college it kinda defeates the purpose for them spending as much time as they do in those states because yes they have a large amount of people but so does every other state, the only large difference now is the amount of electoral votes each one gets. where as with the electoral college they spend more individualized time with each state to try to sway the majority to get all the electoral votes since they cant split them between the candidates. it all comes down to who the smarter candidate is and how they spend time and what they are trying to achive.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1564961572,<span style="color:white">0.593992792</span>,0.249511079]</span>  <span style="color:orange">overall the way it is now makes them wotk harder to win the election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.133184664,<span style="color:white">0.815712968</span>,0.0511023702]</span>  <span style="color:orange">with voting no one likes a tie and without the electoral college that can happen.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.095446642,<span style="color:white">0.815170352</span>,0.0893830328]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In 2000 gore and bush had a fiasco with voting in the presidental election and it was the first time since 1888.
