Dear senator,</br></br>MONTH_DAY_YEAR</br></br><span style="color:orange">I am writing this letter to you today to let you know I stroungly believe that we should demolish the process of electoral college. Why you may ask?</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">First, it is unfair, we are the votes they not.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Second, it is outdated (</br></br>"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br>) Lastly,</br></br><span style="color:orange">First, it is not fair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">We the people are surposed to chose the president not some privite party that we never meet. According to "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer ;according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- wor the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to kind we have now." So we vote yes but he doesn't become president; do we even matter? It doesn't seem like it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Second of all, it is very outdated.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">According to "What Is the Electoral College?" by The Office of the Federal Register this process was founded in the days of the four founding fathers. That's old! Now in days we have found better and fair ways to do pretty much every thing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I hope this letter helps you decide on weather or not we should keep the process of electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Sincerly, PROPER_NAME
