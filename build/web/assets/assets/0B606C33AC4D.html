Excerise is not bad for you, and is actually very healthy. Walking is also a good way to relieve stress and get things off your mind. Sometimes people get mad or upset while driving adn there emotions get in the way of there driving and it ends up badly. So if we get rid of cars it would also decrease the number of accidents. When your walking and you get upset or mad you wont have to take it out on the car or anyone else around you. Walking instead of driving is a better motive especially when we have a high obesity rate. There are so many people in this world with insecurity issues and instead of them not doing anything about and wanting there parents to drive them to go hang out with there friends or go to the beach or whatever the thing is, walk to your friends house or walk to the beach that way you feel better about yourself when you get there and feel like you accomplished something and feel like you feel better about yourself.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0952866674,<span style="color:white">0.686996086</span>,0.2177172656]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In a lot of cities and or countries, there are a lot of "non-safe" streets. There are always car accidents, people dying in these car accidents, there used in some kind of violence. Car accidents are one of the most caused death. This is because people are in a rush so they have to do over the speed limit, people driving recklessly and feel that "oh im cool" or "watch me do this" and ends up in something that they thought at the time wouldnt of happened because they thought they had control. So if getting rid of cars would deffinetly dramatically decrease the number of deaths we have just by getting rid of the cars.Â  Just think of how many lives will be saved! Most of the time thefts are not captured because they always have a run away vehicle to get a way. If we stop using cars, what are they gonna use to get a way? If they try using public transportation to get away, with other people on the bus, he would look suspicious, and get caught. The streets would be a lot safer, especially for adults that have children. Children get snatched up in what? A bicicyle?
