<span style="color:orange">I do not know which one she/he should go with because i know that everybody that has a phone most likely brings it to school everyday. But if she/he says no phones aloud like it is now here people still use them anyway.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think the reason for no cell phones aloud is because you can talk to your friends</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">ask answers on test to cheat and you would interrupt the teacher if you call someone or get a call</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If cell phones are aloud people would defiantly use them all day long and cheat on tests and things like that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also at free times like in between classes and at lunch you can just go talk to your friend without using your phone because its not like you never see them unless they go to a different school</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So if i had to choose one it would be option 2 that students are not aloud to use them in school</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  so they don't cheat on tests and talk to people all day long without listening to the teacher. <span style="color:white">But be able to use them on the bus to and from school if they ride a bus</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">it is not disrupting the teacher and you don't have a paper like a test or a graded class work to cheat on</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . But <span style="color:white">i personally think that students should be able to listen to their Ipods during a test</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">you cant communicate with people and you are not disrupting anyone by talking, and some people do things better while listening to music like it helps a lot when your running because it keeps you mind off it but it will make you work harder on a test. Or i know that it will help me atleast</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So if id pick one it would have to be the 2nd option even though i like the 1st option better.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
