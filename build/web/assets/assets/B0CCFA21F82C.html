<span style="color:orange">My principal says we all have to participate in at least one after school activity. I totally agree with him.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0638764241999999,<span style="color:white">0.892399034</span>,0.0437245222]</span>  <span style="color:orange">One of the reasons why is so we can make more friends and be more comfortable aorund people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0634898238,<span style="color:white">0.882776778</span>,0.0537333942]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The reason why we need to have friends and be more comfortable around people is because friends are always a important part of a persons life. Comfort is also really important because most jobs involve people and if you're uncomfortable around people that could be a problem.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1467375252,<span style="color:white">0.825291582</span>,0.0279709017999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">One of my other reasons is because it helps you with communicaton.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1077097772,<span style="color:white">0.851772892</span>,0.040517328]</span>  For example <span style="color:orange">you can't always be right or get the last word. If one person feels sad and everyone else is happy it's unfair to have one person so we have to consider their feelings too. Therefore I feel like communication is very important because without it it's very hard to do group activities</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2025215939999999,<span style="color:white">0.7695057179999999</span>,0.0279726829999999]</span> . The last reason why I agree with our principal is because <span style="color:orange">it allows you to have fun</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.113549426,<span style="color:white">0.8455934240000001</span>,0.0408571348]</span> , <span style="color:orange">Having fun is very important because we are still young and still deserve to have fun doing the stuff we love with the people we love. If we aren't having any fun as a young person we most likely won't have very much fun older. Not having could lead to sadness which isn't a good thing. It also gives us motivation to get through the day because we know at the end of the day we get to do the thing we love most.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.249496812,<span style="color:white">0.7117822479999999</span>,0.0387209466]</span>  <span style="color:white">These are my reasons why I agree with my principal.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.584407842</span>,0.41254875,0.00304342426]</span> Â
