<span style="color:orange">I know for a fact that when I need advice for something I ask a couple members of my family so I get more advice. Have you ever needed advice? Well if you haven't good for you, but most people need advice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.103329518,<span style="color:white">0.769908772</span>,0.1267617374]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It is better to hear a couple different people so you get more information than what you would get from one side.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0288858049999999,<span style="color:white">0.66822997</span>,0.302884251]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Have you ever had a tough decision to make?

You can get it from anyone including your parents, but the more people you talk to, the more information you will receive. You can always talk to people like you parents, teachers, or even the guidance councilors at your school. No matter who you ask it will be less likely to be bias as long as you ask multiple people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0336877827999999,<span style="color:white">0.7108610260000001</span>,0.255451198]</span>
