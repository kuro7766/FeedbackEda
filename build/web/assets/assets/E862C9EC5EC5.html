<span style="color:orange">The electoral college is a thought that came up long ago by our founding fathers</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Many people calim that it is antiqiuated and needs to be updated but I dissagree.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Although we are the "Democracy of the USA" we are really a republic (chosing representives to vote for us!) This system is much more effective then an ATCHUAL democracy</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Just imagine if on every single issue every single person would have to vote on the outcome to pass anything would take such a long time. Including the elections, the electoral college makes a short sweet way for voting, the population votes and then they vote for what we voted for (most of the time...)</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some people don't trust the electorates with this kind of power</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> Â  <span style="color:orange">but I belive that those people are just parnoid pessmist and need to learn to have more faith in the people that we elect or the president appoints.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The only flaw I see is the even number which calls for a tie.

This way the indivaduals that voted democrate are shown but did not really make as much an impact but it shows and may decide the out come during a tie</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The electoral college Is a clean cut way for voting quick effective. Although we may not be a democracy per say we are all accounted for, just a few tweaks and it'll be perfect.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
