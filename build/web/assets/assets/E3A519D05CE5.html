Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">Although I understand why you would reconsider the policy I believe it could go either way.</br></br>Some students may take advantage of the policy and secretly use it in class.</br></br>Others might take embarrassing photos of somebody else and ruin their life.</br></br>The only way to stop this from happening is to ban cell phones for good, however that can also take away the privileges that some students deserve, so what should happen to the policy?</br></br>Here is my answer.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0635072342,0.53533159,<span style="color:white">0.401161164</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think cell phones should be allowed in school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0493227908,<span style="color:white">0.8334409280000001</span>,0.1172362983999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Many students use their cell phones for entertainment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0770628915999999,<span style="color:white">0.806671654</span>,0.1162654544]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Homework, schoolwork and other things take up a lot of the time in our lives and cell phones help give some people a break</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.079303165,<span style="color:white">0.8468611959999999</span>,0.073835622]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but at the same time it could distract them from their work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0686140972,<span style="color:white">0.8369641</span>,0.0944217928]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">However I think that is a price to pay sometimes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.252490106,<span style="color:white">0.71768354</span>,0.0298263532]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If cell phones help us in our social ways and happiness we shouldn't take it away.</br></br>Yes, it does take us off task or can even disrupt our education but it's up to us individually when we think its enough.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.133985507,<span style="color:white">0.79086693</span>,0.0751475724]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">We take education to help us have a brighter future and cell phones may get in the way but if we all come together, our community or even the whole world and help each other out then we can still have a bright future.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.0922225946</span>,0.6882661820000001,0.219511199]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">However, what good would it be if we're not having fun along the way?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.3446135899999999,<span style="color:white">0.6357806979999999</span>,0.0196057409399999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, I think cell phones should be allowed in school during free times.</br></br>If someone is using it when they shouldn't then they can be punished but let's not leave anyone in the dark if they are having a problem.</br></br>If we help each other out then the world will definitely be a better place.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0625438439999999,<span style="color:white">0.8269197580000001</span>,0.1105363716]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
