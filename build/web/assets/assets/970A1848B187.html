But the article states that when NASA unvieled the image for all to see, the caption that went with it noted a " huge rock formation... which resembled a human head... formed by shadows giving an illution of eyes, nose, and mouth." Also in the article it says the author even reasoned "it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention on mars".</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2087759709999999,<span style="color:white">0.7520884480000001</span>,0.0391355856]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The fact that when the face appeared on the Jet Propultion Lab monitors was short lived also proves that it wasn't a alien</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.163026134</span>,0.8143582740000002,0.0226155892]</span>  <span style="color:white">because if it was they would have probably started doing test and research on it right away or if not right away then soon.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.487174496</span>,0.506732196,0.0060933136]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">On April5, 1998, when Mars GlobalSurveyor flew over it for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.118237284,<span style="color:white">0.861101438</span>,0.0206613004]</span>  <span style="color:orange">a picture ten times sharpper than the orginal photo revealed it was just a natural landform.
