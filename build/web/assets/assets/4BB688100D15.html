<span style="color:orange">Imagine you receiving advice from someone, but you go ask other people because you're not sure if it's considerable. What I would do in this situation is to not ask one person for advice, I would go to other people and listen to their opinions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0474374998,<span style="color:white">0.6782258860000001</span>,0.2743366]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Just by listening to different people's perspective you gain more information to help you find a reliable solution.

You could also involve others by using their opinion, and ask different people about that person's perspective, and see which one would lead you to make a final choice. Finally, another way to involve others to seek a better choice is by expressing your own opinion, and talking to another person to observe your opinion. I find these ways better to trust, so you don't have to involve only one person</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1169163592,<span style="color:white">0.68261755</span>,0.2004660959999999]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">Being curious helps you find a better belief about a situation you are not sure of.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0695030151999999,<span style="color:white">0.7548559420000001</span>,0.175641055]</span>  To be curious you could go up to people for advice, and possibly give them options to see which one has a better meaning. On the other hand, you could be curious by listening to what is important or not, and by asking for examples if you don't quite understand. Asking multiple questions of the person's advice and finding the pro's and con's of the situation is another way of <span style="color:white">being curious</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1033835808</span>,0.742280932,0.1543354448]</span> .

Another way to rely on your peers is to make sure you know them well enough to ask them for advice, and so that you don't go the opposite way of making a consistent choice. However, relying on your peers will make you feel more confident about their opinions, and consider making the right choice. Relying on others will help you follow success by considering others perspectives.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.143297022,<span style="color:white">0.645055412</span>,0.2116475379999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Overall, I think listening to other people's point of view is the key to help you make a better choice.
