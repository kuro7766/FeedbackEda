Dear, Principal</br></br><span style="color:white">I honestly think that the idea of having All students perform community service may be a good idea, but it can also not be a bad idea.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.10528464</span>,0.775407632,0.1193077281999999]</span>  <span style="color:white">There are some students who think the same and want to do the same as others, but there are other students who don't express themselves in that kind of way.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.388838416</span>,0.572394306,0.0387672989]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Students should have a right in deciding what they want to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0696612597999999,<span style="color:white">0.8173985079999999</span>,0.1129402341999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">One reason that this is a good idea is because, if we all work together at this just as a school our world would be a better place just with the help that the kids are supporting our country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0486857914,<span style="color:white">0.741945048</span>,0.2093692002]</span>  It is also a good idea because this can be an opportunity to show kids that there is something we can do to make a change, and we can all be apart of it and still make a big difference. <span style="color:orange">Another reason this is a good idea because it can show kids that instead of being on the computer, or watching t. v , or even sleeping at home we can make a big change, and some students don't realize that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0566324322,<span style="color:white">0.7608318439999999</span>,0.1825357339999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">But, one reason this is a bad idea is because students like to express themselves in anyways possible,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1330264699999999,<span style="color:white">0.783505488</span>,0.083468034]</span>  <span style="color:orange">maybe they don't like to tutor elementary school students, or clean up liter that is not there's. Like me for example I have so many ways of expressing my self. For example I love writing i can write all day, i also like being on the web and home and texting. But by this stuff that i am doing i can also make a change without doing community service. For example because i like writing so much i can write a letter to a animal shelter and help them out. Or who knows, maybe i can even write one to the president of the United States and tell him that we need help down here.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0956497948,<span style="color:white">0.6323133999999999</span>,0.2720368086]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">My point here is any student can express themselves and help others in many ways not just community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.083399342,<span style="color:white">0.78541669</span>,0.13118395]</span>  <span style="color:orange">All kids have hobbies even if they might not know it yet, kids may like to draw, write, play sports, collect money, or even just liking to help others.
