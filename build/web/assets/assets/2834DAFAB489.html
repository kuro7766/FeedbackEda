Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">The question at hand is, "Does the electoral college work?"</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.212308118,<span style="color:white">0.7635792800000001</span>,0.024112587]</span>  <span style="color:orange">My answer to that is simple "yes</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.198212924,<span style="color:white">0.780943018</span>,0.0208440269999999]</span> "<span style="color:orange">,but the reasons why I say this gets a little more complicated. As you may know the founding fathers established it, the Electoral College in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens (Office of the federal register, paragraph 1). Also, A majority of 270 out of 538 electoral voters is required to elect the president. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equal the number of members in its congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representitives plus two for your Senators (Office of Federal Register, Paragraph 3).</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.513624204,<span style="color:white">0.4615818619999999</span>,0.02479393954]</span>  <span style="color:white">Which only goes to show that everyone gets to vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.428288442</span>,0.5569528819999999,0.0147586785]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Some may argue the Electoral; college is an anachronism</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.144438324,<span style="color:white">0.8171354580000001</span>,0.0384262258]</span> , <span style="color:orange">an old and out of date method, or a non-democratic way of selecting a presedint that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. and according to Richard A. Posner they maybe right in the arguing view that the Electoral Colleger method is not democratic in a modern sense. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.
