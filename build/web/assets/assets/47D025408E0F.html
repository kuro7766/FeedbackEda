Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:white">There are many things that can benefit from community service, there are also many things that can not be beneficial.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">One of the things that can benefit from community service is responsibility</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The reason i choose this as a beneficial reasoning is because many kids need respect now days.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Another reason would be to learn how to handle things outside home and school, but also learn how to handle things at home and in school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">There are also bad things that aren't beneficial from community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This is because some kids need time to focus on school priorities as well. For example, say you had an essay paper to do but you had to do community service but you don't finish later. By then you would have forgotten about the paper and you would have also been tired.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">so there is no good outcome from community service as much as there is a beneficial outcome.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
