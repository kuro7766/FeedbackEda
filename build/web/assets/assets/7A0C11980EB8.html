These conditons are so extreme the author explains that "such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed too diving to the deepest parts of our oceans." Venus has very harsh conditions and it make's it virtually impossible to explore it from the surface and proposes a tough challenge on finding alternatives ways to explore it. Although, NASA has proposed an idea to explore the harsh planet. NASA believes we can explore the planet from a distance approximately 30 miles away. The author explains that the pressure would be comparable to sea level on earth, tempature would be around 170 degrees. The author states that "Not easy conditions but survivable for humans." The mission would propose great danger and it would be a expontential battle, but with the right people and technology it could be done and accomplished. The benefit is the knowledge gained from this great planet that has had the world beat for a long time, it is time to step up to the challenge and explore Venus for the people of this world.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.035071052,0.148054336,<span style="color:white">0.8168746139999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">In conclusion, the author supports the exploration of Venus, and is open to finding ways to explore this harsh planet.
