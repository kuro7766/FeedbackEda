One way they can bring up their up and be able to participate in sports is by turning in there homework and completing their work in class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Here at SCHOOL_NAME we have a policy that says " If you have more than three (F)'s you cant participate in a sport"</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">That's why a lot of students try to get a good grade, and that's why the students turn in all their work, in order to participate in a sport.
