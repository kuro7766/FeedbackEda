Ultimately what this system comes down to is the people don't vote for their next president. They are selecting a name that might not do anything to their country</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.218130631,<span style="color:white">0.613310222</span>,0.1685591404]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">Source two talks about the electoral college and how the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1532838111999999,<span style="color:white">0.658473976</span>,0.1882422034]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">In paragraph nine,  the text says, "... according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost presidency, over 60 percent of voters  would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now." The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, "At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0122547474,0.2457932028,<span style="color:white">0.741952038</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Paragrapgh twenty-three, "It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state- Democrates in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0316386701999999,<span style="color:white">0.49913347</span>,0.469227862]</span> " <span style="color:orange">If these people were to vote by the system we have now, their vote would have no effect. This leads to the people living in these states to not vote. They don't even pay attention to the campaign anymore. They know that they won't do anything to the votes or who will become president. They couldn't care less</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0579202967999999,<span style="color:white">0.6245666759999999</span>,0.317513016]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:yellow">We should get rid of the electoral college all together. This system is not working for a lot of people and this is why many people dont care enough to vote anymore. There are people that vote for our state. Why should the people care? If we switched to popular vote, our country might participate in picking who the next president of the United States will be. When people have a voice, they will use it as much as they possibly can.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0276330664,0.439561192,<span style="color:white">0.532805746</span>]</span>
