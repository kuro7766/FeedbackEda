<span style="color:yellow">If it is not broken why should we fix it? The electoral college system has been with us for as long as we have had presidents and one flaw if going to make us scrap eveything? There are many ways to fix the electoral college and throwing the system in the trash should be the last resort.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span>   <span style="color:yellow">Although the election of 2000 is an example of a problem that shoud be fixed it is not a reason to do away with the system.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">To commence with, the electoral college is a fine system that has easily fixed flaws such as the election of George W.

If the electoral college was to be replaced there would be pandemonium as to what system shall replace it, how we will adapt to the new system, and if the system is an improvement or a step back in innovation and our future leaders.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective]</span>
