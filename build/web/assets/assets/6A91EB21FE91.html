<span style="color:orange">Cars were ment to be many things, comfortable, muscle, work, luxury, cheap, and fun for a lot of people. The new cars that they are making should only have safety features that are computer, not the whole car. If a whole car was a computer, what would you do, sit there and eat? you wouldnt be paying attention, you'd be all relaxed, and probably sleeping if you were tired. There are many things that i can say are bad for being in a car that is a computer with a frame, an engine, exhaust manifold, and many more parts.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.1874249929999999,<span style="color:white">0.767979482</span>,0.0445955264]</span>  <span style="color:orange">That is why i disagree/ dislike the fact to have a computer drive you.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.1365814072,<span style="color:white">0.856188532</span>,0.00723005534]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The facts are that there are people building cars that are partially computer driven. For the car that could be bad or good, but if it faults you wont be able to know until it acctually faults while driving which is a huge safety hazard. The car is made for teens, and grown-ups to have fun and comfort or one of them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.517058228</span>,0.4787308680000001,0.00421090214]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The reasons I dislike/ disagree with the self drving is that everybody would become lazy/ on unintellegent about cars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.181252256,<span style="color:white">0.810379038</span>,0.0083686974]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So on my behalf the cars shouldnt be self driven and should have people at the wheels. If the safety features are computer, and not faulty then keep them because it's better to be safe then sorry on the road with idiot drivers, drunks, first time drivers, and semi drivers.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1009115126,<span style="color:white">0.8851826780000002</span>,0.0139057874]</span>
