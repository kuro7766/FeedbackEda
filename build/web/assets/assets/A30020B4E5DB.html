Each state has an elector for each of the members in the House of Representatives.

If the Electoral Colleges aren't in Florida then who else would want to count all of the electoral votes congress. No one has the time to do that unless it's in their job description.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Although an Electoral College can cost a lot of money to build they are still worth it.
