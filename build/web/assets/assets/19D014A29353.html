If i never did my community service i would of have never gotten my respect back for only doing one thing wrong and if you don't have a good relationship with your teacher you will miss out on a lot of fun stuff while your class mates are having all the fun</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The community service wouldn't be what all my classmates thought about it would take place after school like a program you would go around with your friendly class mates in groups pick up trash that your find around your community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I would think of this program as a privilege instead of a horrible thing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>  Thank you for considering my opinion about community service.
