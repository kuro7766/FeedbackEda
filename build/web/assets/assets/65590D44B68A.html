The places were unbelieveble. When I was a cowboy, "I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

We had had so many games. "The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling." with all these games we never wanted to leave the sea. If you came too, you could do play too.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  We spent so much time having fun I knew it was the best decision I made.</br></br><span style="color:orange">After all those years I stopped, but I still remember the adventure.

The trip was definintly worth it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
