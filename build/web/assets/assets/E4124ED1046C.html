It is very common to find them on Mars in the region of Cydonia. <span style="color:yellow">The Martian mesa was naturally formed, but with its shadows, it looks much like a face.

There are many mesa's in the region of Cydonia and that's a part of how we found out how it was a natural landform. Also the Surveyour verified that there wasn't any other monuments near the landform. If there was any life on Mars we would want to tell the people so they can be intrested in the activity at NASA, but for now there has not been found any life activiy on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0308264714,0.6266867960000001,<span style="color:white">0.3424867394</span>]</span>
