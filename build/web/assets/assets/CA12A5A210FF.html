Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I am aware that you want your students to do well in school. Everyone, even if they don't admit it, wants to do good in school. I agree with your policy, and I also disagree with your policy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I agree with it because I think if the students really wanted to participate in activities, they must raise their grades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">But if they really wanted to participate, they can all work hard to get their grades up.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Well, I also disagree with your policy. I think if some kids really do struggle in school, they wont be able to participate in any other activities. I don't really think that is fully fair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Us students want to participate in fun activities and some really struggle. We all need time to get away from school to have fun and your not letting some students have that time. I am an average B student, and I do not participate in other activities like sports.</br></br>I really have no right to say anything, but I am supporting my friends who love sports.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I do mostly agree with you. If you really want something, you should try your hardest to aim for it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Say, you wanted to play basketball and you had a C average. If you have a C average, you cannot play</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If you really really want to play basketball, try to get a B average to aim higher and higher in life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think your policy will give us students a lesson to learn to aim for your goals and learn to know if you really want something, you must try your hardest to aim for it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
