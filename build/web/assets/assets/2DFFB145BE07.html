(paragraph 11) There is only one really good arguement against this, and not a lot of people look at this as such a bad thing. Yes, people who don't want this method will use this arguement, but when someone else throws an argument backing it up they will have no rebutal to rest their case.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.3917754519999999,<span style="color:white">0.5846685060000001</span>,0.023556055]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">"The Electoral College consists of 538 electors.
