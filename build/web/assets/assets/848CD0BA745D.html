<span style="color:yellow">The schedule of a student attending any learning facility is made up of a list of their designated classes. A typical school day for them is to come to school, attend all the classes listed to them on that specific day, and go home.

In addition, a majority of the classes prohibit the use of cellphones to ensure that a students focus on the academic work given to them. In a home, there would be a noticeable difference. Most homes have some kind of electronic devices such as televisions or radios which students would have unrestricted access to.

This would not benefit them since they would not be getting the full context of what is being taught to them when they are attending classes from home compared to when they attend classes at a school since at home, they are surrounded by numerous distractions</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.001044408298,0.0918898566,<span style="color:white">0.907065732</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Another major issue that would rise from students being able to attend classes from home is the dependence of technology that would be needed to teach the kids.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.001339088188,0.1395763259999999,<span style="color:white">0.859084534</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">A major aspect of students attending classes from home is that all the teaching would have to be done online.

Sometimes, technology isn't always reliable since it could easily stop working or lag. If this were to happen, a student wouldn't be able to access the classes he/she would have that day and in doing so, miss the content that was being taught in the class. This would not benefit them because if any day the computer or cellphone of a student was to not work, they would completely miss what was being taught in the class</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000641895766,0.056110626,<span style="color:white">0.943247478</span>]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Now, the student could make up what they missed on another day</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.00626238796,<span style="color:white">0.353207544</span>,0.6405300820000001]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">however it is still more of a workload compared to if they were at a school.
