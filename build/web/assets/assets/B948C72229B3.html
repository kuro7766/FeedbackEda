Sometimes people aren't sure what to do in certain situations so they ask for advice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0179480374,0.382392824,<span style="color:white">0.599659128</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.01597410214,0.433804066,<span style="color:white">0.5502218259999999</span>]</span>  because <span style="color:yellow">other people may have more experience with the topic,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00574738524,0.29216761,<span style="color:white">0.702085034</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">you can learn a lot from others,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00891758148,0.334584278,<span style="color:white">0.656498112</span>]</span>  and <span style="color:yellow">getting multiple opinions can help you feel more confident in what you are choosing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0050643957,0.28490803,<span style="color:white">0.7100275779999999</span>]</span>  Advice can be very helpful.</br></br>First, other people may have more experience on the topic than you. <span style="color:yellow">If you haven't dealt with something much then it will be very useful to get advice and opinions from multiple people who have dealt with your problem before. You should ask numerous people about their past experiences to find out what worked best for them. All of that will help you come to a decision that will hopefully work out. Humans who have more knowledge on your subject will be wiser and can give you a lot of important input to think about when it comes to making a choice. I personally like to talk to my parents about issues because they know much more than I do and usually make the right choices.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00273827786,0.1096321694,<span style="color:white">0.8876295860000001</span>]</span> </br></br>Next, you can learn more about your problem from others. <span style="color:yellow">When talking to multiple people they may point out some things you never noticed or thought about, they can also look at your situation from another point of view. This is good because you may be focused on one thing but there could be many other important details that you overlooked. You should always ask more than one person about your problem so that you get a range of opinions and not just one that could be biased. Others may also have more information that you were not aware of.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0027616513,0.1252585852,<span style="color:white">0.8719797760000001</span>]</span> </br></br>Finally, if you talk to lots of people and receive their opinions, it will help you feel more confident about the decision you choose. <span style="color:yellow">If you are making a hard choice, it is important to feel good about what you decide. Knowing that other people agree with you and having a lot of feedback will make you more comfortable with your choice. It can also be less stressful if you know that others believe you are doing the right thing. Many people greatly care about what others think so it can be a relief if they are helped and supported in making a good choice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00771113732,0.2079638639999999,<span style="color:white">0.784325</span>]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, <span style="color:orange">listening to others advice can be very beneficial. You should always talk to numerous people about important decisions. I think that getting multiple opinions will help people make the best choice because they will gain more information on their problem, they will be more comfortable with their choice, and others might have dealt with similar problems before so they have more knowledge on the issue. No one has to try to find a solution on their own.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0033396994,<span style="color:white">0.2047669299999999</span>,0.79189338]</span>
