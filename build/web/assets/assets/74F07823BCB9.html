However, with distance learning students who are out sick can still learn what they need for the day, and participate in class as normal. Some students who are very dedicated to their learning, may go to school when they are sick so they wont miss out on anything important. This can be dangerous to the health and well being of their classmates. With the introduction of distance learning, the sick student's classmates are safe and the student can continue with their education.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.00273041278,<span style="color:white">0.1403748692</span>,0.8568947340000002]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Many schools recently have prioritized integrating technology in the classroom wherever possible, and have seen the benefits from doing so.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00314779148,0.187141988,<span style="color:white">0.809710244</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Distance learning is yet another beneficial example of technology integration in the classroom. Without distance learning as an option students who miss a day have to catch up with the rest of the class by either talking to their teacher individually or getting the materials beforehand for planned absences. This puts extra stress on the students as well as the teachers who have to spend time worrying about individual students. With distance learning, however, teachers can spend more time focusing on the class as a whole and the standards of learning for all of their students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.01306372194,<span style="color:white">0.2724952047999999</span>,0.714441048]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Students who suffer from social anxiety, or are bullied in school may also benefit from distance learning.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00320947062,0.232236878,<span style="color:white">0.76455364</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Social anxiety may hinder a students ability to learn, especially in loud and very social settings like the classroom. being able to attend class from home would allow these students to learn in comfortable and familiar environments with less distraction form the learning that needs to be done.
