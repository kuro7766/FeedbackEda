I even got a little of the benefit of seeing Europe and China. I also went to Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ridein Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also got to see an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.</br></br>Also, when I help out other people first, it makes me feel good second off it perpares me for hard work along the way of my life. I also got to be a night watchman I did get hurt a little but, before the week was over I was back to work, and better than ever.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.51621575,<span style="color:white">0.462343448</span>,0.0214408146]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I came here to try to explain how much I loved this trip.
