<span style="color:orange">Dear, state senator I think changing elections by popular vote for the president of the United States would be better.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Each candidate had his or her group of electors. Mostly the political party like Democratic and Republican. he Electoral college is the established Constitution as a compromise between electionof the presdident by vote in congress. Popular votes for the election of the president is more meaningful then having 538 electors and 270 electoral votes. I think the electoral college doesn't work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In the electoral college system,voters just vote for the president, but along with that your voting for more electors in their political party.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This is a very big deal for the people voting in elections. They have no control of whom their electors votr for.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The electoral college is also unfair to the canidates because the winner-take-all system in each state.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">The best arguments in favor is the popular vote, but some canidates still lose from the presidency.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Looking at the breakdown of the number of electoral votes given to each state-California has the most votes. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">or instance, as Romney was in the South he had no campaign heavily in those states. He gained no electoral votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">In toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really take notice inthe competing canidates. Those voters sre the ones to decide the election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Run-Off elections should be avoided, it would greatly complicate the presidential election process.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">My advice to you;as the state senator is to not keep the Electoral College. The election of the populae vote would be more precised. It's maybe 1% unfair because in states like california they have like 55,000 republicans voting for 1 canidate. And if there's a tie in the electoral vote, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
