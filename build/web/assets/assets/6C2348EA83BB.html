Mostly the political party like Democratic and Republican. he Electoral college is the established Constitution as a compromise between electionof the presdident by vote in congress. Popular votes for the election of the president is more meaningful then having 538 electors and 270 electoral votes. I think the electoral college doesn't work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.5256112940000001,<span style="color:white">0.467277022</span>,0.00711167456]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In the electoral college system,voters just vote for the president, but along with that your voting for more electors in their political party.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.124484072,<span style="color:white">0.8494097999999999</span>,0.0261061042]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This is a very big deal for the people voting in elections.

The election of the populae vote would be more precised. It's maybe 1% unfair because in states like california they have like 55,000 republicans voting for 1 canidate. And if there's a tie in the electoral vote, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1905065731999999,<span style="color:white">0.778006256</span>,0.0314871846]</span>
