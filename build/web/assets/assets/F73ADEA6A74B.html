To the principal:</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I think it is a brilliant idea for us the students, to take on a opportunity to help out by doing community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> <span style="color:orange">. I think it is brilliant because it would be like a win-win situation where it benefits both the community and us.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">If everybody gets a chance to help out the community I think we should take it! It would be great doing something to give back to our community seeing that not many people are interested in helping out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Not only will the environment become a safer place to live in but, it will also become a healthier place.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">What would happen if after a while no one took care of our community? For an example It's like taking care of your room, what if one day you decided not to put things in there proper places and just threw things anywhere and left it untidy? It might begin to smell, or you might even discover things missing. So taking care of our community is like taking care of own self. Doing this could be a really good deed, giving back to the community to make it a healthier place. For example, maybe we can go 2-3 times a week picking up trash, even just starting with our own football field.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span>  In closing i would like to say, <span style="color:orange">you should really think about this and decide to take part in it because it would make our community better and cleaner and it</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
