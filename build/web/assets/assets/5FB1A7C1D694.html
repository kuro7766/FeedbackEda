<span style="color:yellow">Tim Ryan, an experienced bird watcher once said, "In middle school, somebody started the weirdest club imaginable... a bird watching club. Being the class clown that I was, my friends and I signed up for the oddest club at school. At first, it was just funny. Then I found myself looking forward to club day. Bird watching was a ton of fun. If I wasn't required to sign up for a club, I would never have found my true passion -- bird watching." School required extracurricular activities have been controversial for many years. Is it a waste of time? Are the activities even fun?

However, all of my friends are good at basketball. When club time rolled around at school, I got pressured into joining the basketball club with them. It turns out that times have changed. I'm pretty good at basketball. I've been feeling much better about myself knowing that I'm good at something." By requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, Generic_Name found that she was really good at basketball. A talent could be hidden under your surface.

Part of his job is to work with others to cultivate ideas for school programs. The council has taught him the importance of expressing his opinions and ideas. The council has made Evan much more confident about his opinions and now expresses them throughout daily life. A student council is not the only activity that can boost your communication skills. Those skills will increase anywhere that you are working together, which is usually any activity. By improving your communication skills, you are preparing for the future. You will need to be able to have excellent communication skills during college, work, and just daily life. In addition, you could make many friends.
