Al Gore won the popular vote nationwide over Bush, he still didnt win the presidency because the electoral college did not stay true to their word and voted for Bush. That is because, as shown in Source 3, paragraph 15, " When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00229913394,0.0924957771999999,<span style="color:white">0.905205068</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">So while you might think your individual vote makes a difference</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.0144185219,0.329032826,<span style="color:white">0.656548634</span>]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">it doesnt at all, for you are not choosing which presidential candidate to vote for, you are voting for someone else to vote for the president who might not always stay true to their word and vote for a different candidate.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Effective/0.0056810964,0.19333541,<span style="color:white">0.800983456</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Although the electoral college does bring better certainty of outcome than a popular vote, it does not have the certainty it claims to have.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00266810402,0.11952285,<span style="color:white">0.8778090200000002</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">In Source 2, paragraph 12 it states, "Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote." This is a big worry because the electoral college holds a total of 538 votes which is definetely possible to cause a tie. If this were to happen, then the vote would be thrown to the House of Representatives where state delegations would vote on the president. Then the concept of the presidential campaigns would become pointless because the point of campaining is to try to win over large, swing states to ensure more votes. Because the bigger the states population, the more votes they hold in the electoral college. But that would only work if it was in the Senates hands because the amount of representatives in the Senate for each state is based off of population, whereas the amount of representatives in the House of Representatives is always two for each state. So if the vote was thrown into the House of Representatives hands, then whichever candidate who holds claim over the most states, regardless of size, would almost automatically win the election because each state holds equal say in their vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.001610748642,0.0262925151999999,<span style="color:white">0.972096732</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So because the electoral college is obviously unfair, it should be abolished. Because the voters are told they decide who reopresents them, yet they do not. There is a possibility, while slim that a president could win the popular votes, yet lose the election because of the way the electoral college is set up. So because it unfair to the presidential candidates, it should be abolished and we should have elections controlled by popular votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0013713941,<span style="color:white">0.074398014</span>,0.9242305900000002]</span>
