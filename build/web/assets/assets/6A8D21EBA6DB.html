With futher improvments on computer hardware and sensors, automakers can design car that can handle more driving tasks on their own.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The anitlock brake and driver assticance system has made its own way on helping the full invention of driverless cars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that with the technolgy progressing consumers can have a driverless cab take us wherever we would like to go. Along with the sensors the radar will help with the antilock system to make that dream come ture.</br></br>BMW has already annouced the development of "Traffic Jam Assistant". It's a car the can handle driving up to 25 mph, but touch sensors keeps the driver holding the wheel in case of a malfunction. The human driver must remian alert and be able to take over in certain situations.
