Also as well if you dont play sports but you try out for a team you might just like and get real good at that sport. We even have a better idea say if you can dance or cheer you might can talk to your principal about being your school mascot you might can get some fans,or have a cheer leading team for the sports. Try to talk to your principal about having a concession stand to sell snacks to the players and people who come watch the game. If you are good at keeping record you can be the person who keeps track of the fouls, timeouts, and keeping track of the numbers scored.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.4021154799999999,<span style="color:white">0.58982735</span>,0.008057181]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The SCA is when host the school dances or fundraisers.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.344315698</span>,0.652902474,0.0027818444]</span>  <span style="color:white">They do school dances by getting it all planed like getting a DJ, food, games, buses.

You can compete against people in battle games or sport games. Say if you like sports you just dont like playing it in real life only in video games because it seems better to you thats okay.
