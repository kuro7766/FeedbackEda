Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I strongly believe that students should get to have a C average to work in sports or other activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Without this opportunity, many children will lack in physical</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">With a B average, many students may not keep up to that level, which overtime, makes them grow weaker.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Not having activities and sports will hurt people physically, but also mentally. It can cause more stress to student's minds.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Students should get as much physical activity as they want, but if they have to have a B average, then this will make them get worse at what they may do best</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">These people should be getting enough freedom to do an activity for at least a C average. They will lack in physical skills and it may even mess up peoples dreams. If you know most of your students maintain at a C average, then leave them like that</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Of course, changing the policy might make them work harder</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> , but <span style="color:white">its just not fair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Students may see a positive change in there grade average</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> , but <span style="color:orange">if someone likes to play a sport, then there shouldn't be a change in policy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There will be a positive side, but also a negative side to it. Students will get weaker without working in sports, or may even be much more lonely</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">In a young persons life, they don't want to be lonely. They want to be more social and talk with friends, participate in an activity. All these things help students grow up more healthier in life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Some students may think its easy, but for most, it is hard. Since most of your students have a C average, then there is some bad effects on changing it to a B average</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">One important thing is stress</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Every student wants to go to school stress free and going to special activities is a huge help in that. If people have to maintain a B average, it can add stress, because they are so caught up into trying so hard to maintain a B average. Stress at a young age may cause students to have a more lonely life. They may not have a social life and be sad most of the time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">As you see, principle, it is a much better idea to keep the policy the same. Students will lack physical education, it will have a bad negative affect, and it causes more stress to students, if sports and activities are only open to B average students. People will not like this new idea because they used to have so much of a good time, but with this, it could possibly change their life a lot.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>From: STUDENT_NAME
