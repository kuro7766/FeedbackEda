Texting and Driving</br></br><span style="color:orange">Thousands of people die every year from people driving and texting.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0806309849999999,<span style="color:white">0.8144565480000001</span>,0.1049124707999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Texting and driving should be banned because it puts other people's lives in danger.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0398484302,<span style="color:white">0.79878783</span>,0.161363739]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If a person crashes his or her car while driving, insurance on their vehicle could go up</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0521182822,<span style="color:white">0.788501886</span>,0.1593798488]</span> . <span style="color:orange">A car crash can also kill loved ones,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0493370644,<span style="color:white">0.792875598</span>,0.1577873286]</span>  <span style="color:orange">people riding with the intention of getting to point A to point B can be dismissed because of a car accident and a careless driver.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0987700606,<span style="color:white">0.728166722</span>,0.1730632161999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The main reason why why people text while driving is because they are really addicted to their cellular devices.

Full coverage is the best one, it can back up anybody that gets in a car accident.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.113161314,<span style="color:white">0.78336672</span>,0.1034719388]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The liability insurance is good too, but it does not cover that much if a person gets involved in a car accident. So, going with full coverage should be the best choice. Insurance insures your vehicle, driving without insurance is illegal. If a person gets into a car accident, insurance is there to help but if a person was too busy distracted on their phone, the insurance payment will go up. A driver that gets him or herself into an accident and they were very distracted on their phone, there could be some bad consequences.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1165486132,<span style="color:white">0.771226652</span>,0.1122247339999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Getting into an accident can cause serious problems to the vehicle getting hit</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0703967802,<span style="color:white">0.785616088</span>,0.1439871384]</span> . <span style="color:white">The vehicle can be totaled which means that the vehicle can no longer be driven</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.140413002</span>,0.83126707,0.0283199092]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If the driver goes too fast and he or she has their family aboard, they could be seriously injured if they crash.

Some people don't even drive anymore knowing what they did to a loved one. Losing a family member in a car accident is very sad, and very disappointing to the driver.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1005825564,<span style="color:white">0.817637824</span>,0.0817796156]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Texting while driving is very dangerous.

Distracted driving could be the cause of many fatalities but placing the phone down while driving could save millions.
