They are not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency.</br></br>Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, the system allows for much worse.</br></br>Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.(So that a popular vote for kennedy.) In the same vein, "faithless" electors ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.</br></br>At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have nochance of winning. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters Ohio, they have yet to make it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.471189802,<span style="color:white">0.312717226</span>,0.2160929652]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Pretty much anywhere you go whether it's school or work, you will hear that as an American Citizen, you have the right to vote.
