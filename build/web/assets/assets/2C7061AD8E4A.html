<span style="color:orange">My name is Proffesor Yado, and my colleague and I were discussing on the infamous "Face on Mars". My colleague believes in superstition and conspiracies so he stated that the face on Mars must be of extraterrestrial origin. I said that was porposterous, but my colleague continued to try and convince me to no availe.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0898682834,<span style="color:white">0.65054774</span>,0.259583967]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I told my colleague there are many reasons why the some scientists and people thought the "Face on Mars" looked like a face.

If there was a actual structure left by aliens, modern cameras would be able to see it. The the more modern cameras of today are able to see the more defining features of a object.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0421366253999999,<span style="color:white">0.5813978000000001</span>,0.37646557]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Secondly humans are remarkably good at seeing faces when there is not one there.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0453433526,<span style="color:white">0.6885215579999999</span>,0.26613507]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When you look at a wall socket you can see what resembles a face when there is not one there. It is the same thing with the "Face on Mars". With the aid of shadows from the Sun, are ability to see faces when none are there, and the angle the picture was taken, the butte or mesa looks remarkably like a face or some alien made structure.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0375808356,<span style="color:white">0.55770472</span>,0.404714476]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In response to what I said my colleague had some things to say to try and disprove me.
