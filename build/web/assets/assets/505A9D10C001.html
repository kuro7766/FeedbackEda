The idea of a driverless car may put a person to ease, to where they aren't paying attention to the road ahead. The at ease person may become stressed when the car signals to take over. They might not even be ready to take over the wheel. This is a risky thing when coming to complicated traffic issues.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.17672322,<span style="color:white">0.7929430399999999</span>,0.0303337445]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">These driverless cars also seem to be very expensive, something not the everyday person could afford.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0783554662,<span style="color:white">0.827667336</span>,0.0939772148]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The car has even been know to be to costly without the price of the car itself. The article talks about the use of smart roads for the smart cars. "These smart-road systems worked suprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical." The car itself needs a lot of mechanics, such as Dubbed LIDAR, to make sure the vehicle can mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2498169499999999,<span style="color:white">0.7258587400000001</span>,0.0243243294]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The article talks a lot about the future of these driverless cars. But I do not think there will be such a future. With the concern of a person's life at risk, the driverless cars will intimidate many. The cost issue will also be an intimating factor. With manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan, many will not be able to afford it. Overall, the bad outweighs the good for this project. The driverless car is simply just not worth it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0769823315999999,<span style="color:white">0.77289965</span>,0.1501180355]</span>
