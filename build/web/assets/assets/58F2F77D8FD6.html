By according to Dr. Huang notes he says " So computers need to understand that too.".</br></br>Your home computer or work computer cannot modify Mona Lisa smile.

For examples, say a child is got bully in the cafeteria for his lunch money and he just walks out the cafeteria with a frown on his face and he doesn't want to show his emotion toward the dean and/or teacher so thats when they can used the FACS technology to figure out there emotions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1070444439999999,<span style="color:white">0.8836411399999999</span>,0.00931444194]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The FACS is very helpful for humans that performs the same impressive "calculation" everyday.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.254066268,<span style="color:white">0.74247509</span>,0.0034585987]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Of course, most of us can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look of there face , you can probably tell by the look of there faces when they are happy, sad, worried that why Lenardo da Vinci made the Mona Lisa picture and his crew from making the FACS technology. The author is giving us the mood of encouraging because without the FACS technology then we would never know how people feel when it comes down to the people that don't show emotions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.19207918,<span style="color:white">0.802970204</span>,0.0049506483999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion , FACS is very useful in many different sceranio. If it wasnt for the FACS technology then we wouldn't know how kids,adults,students,teachers and etc feel. Another thing is that the FACS technology is very helpful because that it can tell if a student is bored , and/or even tired. While a regular computer can tell if the student is bored. I would reccomend this in schools,hostipals, doctors office , or even in the dentist area.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0761332992,<span style="color:white">0.909242368</span>,0.01462431374]</span>
