<span style="color:orange">Dear mr. senator i think that we should keep the electoral college eclections. I believe the electoral college is a better system than any other.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Some of my reasoning is it is the easiest way to elect someone.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Second reason is it is very fast quick to elect.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Final reason is it work fine. My mom always tells me you dont fix whats not broke.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This method has worked for a very long time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If a method like this has worked thid long i think we should keep it until it doesnt work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Then when it stops working we could start a new type of election. Many people have used this type of election the whole life and we still use it today so i think we should keep this way of our elections.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">The first reason is it one of the easiest ways to elcet.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">In the story it says the "electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors is where they vote for the president and vice president , and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">My second reason is it is very fast.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">They get the electoral votes in and start counting. Within a couple of hours they have tha answer. they can find out who wins in just a couple of weeks.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">My final reason is it works good.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If it didn't work good it still wouldn't be around today. in the story it says that the electoral college was established by our founding fathers.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So i think this is the process we should use to elect our people even if it is still an old way of doing things.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
