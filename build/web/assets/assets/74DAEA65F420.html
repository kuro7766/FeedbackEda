Having schools give us projects during the summer will be fun.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.029849447,<span style="color:white">0.5152123019999999</span>,0.454938232]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I believe schools should have these projects be student-designed</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0254084389999999,<span style="color:white">0.6273037680000001</span>,0.3472878159999999]</span>  because <span style="color:yellow">students would be more inclined to do them</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00943740622,0.4194869719999999,<span style="color:white">0.571075608</span>]</span>  and <span style="color:yellow">it would be enjoyable.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0130814869,0.449917254,<span style="color:white">0.537001258</span>]</span> </br></br>If these projects were student-designed the students would be more willing to do them since they would be choosing the topic to work on. <span style="color:yellow">In my experiences, if my mom told me to do something I didn't want to do I would not do it to the best of my abilities. However, if I choose what to do it wouldn't feel as a 'must' but rather a 'want,' so I would take my time doing it. Students would have a good time doing a project they are interested in; they would be excited when working on it.

I typically don't want to do school work during my breaks; so, if I had to choose what topic I would be working on, it would be more enjoyable for me. I will still be learning of course but I would be working on something I am interested in.
