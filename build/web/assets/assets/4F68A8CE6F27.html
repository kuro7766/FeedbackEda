Dear TEACHER_NAME</br></br><span style="color:orange">Some people might think that doing community service is mindless and stupid, but i think it's a great way to help people who don't have a well planned out education or who don't have a house or just cleaning up the environment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0461870161,<span style="color:white">0.578849258</span>,0.374963734]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I help the community out by cleaning up litter, donating my old clothes to the poor, also by donating canned food to the soup kitchen and by recycling. The people who don't want to do community service don't have to, they can just help out by donating canned foods or just recycling cans.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0977455014,<span style="color:white">0.6202054840000001</span>,0.2820490251999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think you don't have to make the students do community service if they don't want to. Just put up sign up sheets in the hallways and have people sign up on their own time or just create a group that cleans up the school grounds before or after school hours.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.257475334,<span style="color:white">0.653356562</span>,0.089168106]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some of my friends disagree with me about community service,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.364277775,<span style="color:white">0.611125732</span>,0.0245965054]</span>  <span style="color:white">but they can think what they want to think and so can I.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.6117439779999999</span>,0.37595675,0.01229925388]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I for one think that doing community service is a good thing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.3468748739999999,<span style="color:white">0.6382254460000001</span>,0.0148996843]</span> </br></br>Sincerely</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
