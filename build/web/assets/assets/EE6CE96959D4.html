<span style="color:white">I have mixed feelings about the FACS technology it could be great now but when people or robots with their own minds want to do bad or harm the people of the world this would be a great start.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">See, now this could be used as something just for fun then it's gonna get upgraded to federal level and be able to decieve criminals. Then a deranged rogue is gonna get the hold of it and try to take over the world</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Sounds like a movie doesn't it, but stuff like the FACS were in movies way back when and now have we them in real life. I can't be the only one that sees this happening.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">But the good side I heve for this technology is that it can help people. Or help people to help other people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Like such, what if our friend is acting wierd. Which they commonly do. Just out of the ordinary behavior like being more quiet or not wanting to spend as much time with you as usual. So you trick i mean tell them stand in front of your wierd computer, your FACS. They do it, it scans the 44 major muscles in their face. It tells you that she's 20% mad, 10% happy, and 70% sad. So now you help her with he predicaments and you guys live happily ever after.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Some other ways the FACS may be good invention is that it can be used as a lie detector</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">As said in paragraph 8 you use different muscles for a genuine smile than for a false or fake one. It can be used by the FBI in interviewing or interogation. Or you could see when a politician is faking it also conveyed in pagraph 8.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">So yeah, I dont really know how to feel. There's bad good way this thing couls affect the world. But there's pro and cons to everything I guess.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
