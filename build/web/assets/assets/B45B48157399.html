<span style="color:orange">Schools should use facial action coding system because its use full for school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">One reason why schools should use facial action coding system because it can be use full for health classes</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:white">health classes effect how much your emotions affect your body for example if you're always depressed you'll have a chance that your body might suffer from something and you might have a hard time to bring your body to stay strong again after suffering from depression and if your always happy you won't have a problem.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">My Second reason why schools should use facial action coding because a day on a test. A day on a test you'll have a emotion that you don't wanna take it or just too lazy to do the test</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">might end up the person guessing all the problems and not even caring. The next day they would see there scores in the test and be embarassed because they got there score low.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">My Third reason why schools should use facial action coding because incase of a fight. People might be angry and might take there anger away on someone else</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">it could manage to start a fight that's why you can check on them and ask why are they angry and calm them down. You never know if that could happen so always be prepared.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>
