<span style="color:orange">The author did really well by being specific and being descriptive about Venus. There was a lot of detail which made it long and a little boring.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.09104495,<span style="color:white">0.8863338479999999</span>,0.022621177]</span>  <span style="color:white">Not everyone wants to read about Venus, but it is a nice planet but when you are being forced to it's not the best choice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.541118218</span>,0.4550070300000001,0.0038747478399999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Things that the authro did good on was being very descriptive.

They also gave some good detail about how it's been around 3 decades since someone has tried going to Venus. They have an enormous amount of facts.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.210713536,<span style="color:white">0.774723644</span>,0.0145628174]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Something they could improve on is not make it as lengthy.

Make it a tiny bit more interesting if you put something other than just straight facts. I strongly reccomend putting in some opinion in the next story. For example put some opinion on maybe what you think about a certain fact.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.298918862,<span style="color:white">0.6866713179999999</span>,0.0144098296]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This overall was a great story and the author did a great job writing it. There are a few thing I would do different to grab the readers attention and try and keep it. The story doesn't keep my attention but it may to someone that loves since or maybe even Venus, but I'm not that person. Anyways great story overall just a few nit picks I wanted to point out. I can't wait for a new one next year!</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.211792266,<span style="color:white">0.769028212</span>,0.0191795374]</span>
