The scientsts flew to Cydonia for the first to take pictures of the original Viking photos. Thousands were waiting for the image first appeared on a JPL web site. The web site had revealed that the face was not an alien, but it was an natural landform.</br></br>Michael Malin and his Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times haper than the original photo. Face was located at 41 degree north matian latitude where it was winter in april, 1998. The camera showed the image and there was no alien monument after all. The picture actually shows the Marian equivalent of a butte landform common around the American West. The scientists tried it again and they just don't pass over the Face very often.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.443400066,<span style="color:white">0.528988176</span>,0.0276117523]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The face is an natural landform like the article said</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.175710552</span>,0.82089784,0.00339158844]</span>
