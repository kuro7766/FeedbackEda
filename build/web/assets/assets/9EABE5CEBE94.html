<span style="color:yellow">Generic_Name sighed while he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, and was pretty bummed that he realized he didn't join any clubs or sports during his time at school. Even though his friends recommended that he should, he didn't really want to do it. All of his friends that joined activities made cool, new friends in the clubs they were in, and became more active when they participated in sports. He was upset that he didn't do any of those things in middle school, but decided that he would give it a chance when he went to high school. When he got home, Generic_Name thought about the kinds of clubs he wanted to join, and different sports he wanted to participate in, and was looking forward to it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.00398404826,0.0920287512,<span style="color:white">0.90398724</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity during school</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0572652913999999,0.514404328,<span style="color:white">0.4283303939999999</span>]</span>  because <span style="color:yellow">it can help you make new friends</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00916825712,0.260883018,<span style="color:white">0.729948722</span>]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">help you become more fit/ stay active depending on the activity</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0071255319,0.2329879759999999,<span style="color:white">0.759886468</span>]</span> , and <span style="color:orange">can improve your skills on specific things</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.00924391562,<span style="color:white">0.260611</span>,0.7301451059999999]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">If you join any sports or clubs, you are definitely going to meet new people to make your friends, which is a great thing because it gives you people to talk to and get along with so you won't be by yourself in any activities you would do after school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01754902816,0.325440196,<span style="color:white">0.6570107519999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">However, some people don't like joining clubs because they could be antisocial or can be nervous and have trouble meeting new people</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.01086677288,0.276927298,<span style="color:white">0.712205948</span>]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">but it's okay, it takes time to get used to people you dont know, so joining clubs and making new friends can help you be more social and find it easier to get along with others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Effective/0.0112486689,0.263397766,<span style="color:white">0.72535357</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Joining sports/ physical clubs can help you stay in shape and stay healthy</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00748308478,0.240950166,<span style="color:white">0.751566748</span>]</span>  because <span style="color:yellow">most sports will most likely have you break a sweat, and a lot of sports include running and jumping, and require some strength.
