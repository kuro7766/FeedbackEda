Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Ill like to talk to you about us students being required to perform community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">My position on this subject is the students should have the choice to do community service or not, they shouldn't be required to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  Here are some reasons why it should be our choice.</br></br><span style="color:orange">It should be our choice to do community service or not because first of all we as children or preteens shouldn't be required or forced to do those kind of things</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  cause <span style="color:white">we our children not adults, and there is nothing in this country stating we have to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also sometimes from school, sports, and other activities we do we are very busy as is</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , and <span style="color:orange">adding community service on to that we just make us more stressed as we sometimes are with all those things going on</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Another reason why we shouldn't is that we want to hang out with friends and do a lot of fun things with them</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">such as going to the mall, seeing a movie, and playing outside on a nice day, but if we have community service we cant do all those things.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  Then <span style="color:orange">with a lot of people saying children have to start getting outside and getting more active, what are we going to do if we have community service to do</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">we wont be able to get more active, are we</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . Also <span style="color:orange">sometimes we receive a lot of homework at school or have a big project to do,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  t<span style="color:orange">hen if we have to do community service we might not be able to finish it before school the next day, which can get us behind on what we were doing in that class and ruining our grades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This is why i think students shouldn't have to be required to do community service coming from a student stand point. Thank you for reading and i hope you consider my concern</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
