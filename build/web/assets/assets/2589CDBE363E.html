Dear Senator</br></br><span style="color:yellow">In the year 2000 there was a presidental election. The two canadate runnning were Bush and Gore. In that election there was a problem, Gore had won the votes of the people but Bush had won the votes of the the Electoral votes. Now the question is asked who should win, should the person who had the most votes from the people win or the person who had the most votes from the Electoral College win? This is something that has been going on for a long time, does the Electoral College over rule the people? This is an importain question that we the people should be asking, do we realy pick the persendent or does the Electoral College pick it and we are just there for show?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0243942534,0.319726572,<span style="color:white">0.655879184</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The Electoral College is an out dated sistem that we keep because the goverment wants there to be a clear winner, but we know that is not what the people the people want the right to dicide.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0459292855999999,0.591717808,<span style="color:white">0.362352892</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers and made as a "compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualifies citizens."
