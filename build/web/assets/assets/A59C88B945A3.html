He thinks that they are so smart they made that face to drag humans into Mars. Some Alien maybe had to make a sacrifice? I think that landform and the sun had something to do with it. The sun probably melted some land, or maybe it moved just right to make this face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The fact that "The Face of Mars" got popular and got out there suprised me</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:white">I would be kinda shocked though, if I was someone at home and someone comes and tells me "They descovered a Face on Mars".
