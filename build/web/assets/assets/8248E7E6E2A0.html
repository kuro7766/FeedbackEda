I think having gym at school is the most important because that's the only free time we ever get while we are in school.</br></br>If we was to end up having gym rules where we couldn't participate only if we had a B average nobody would even want to go to gym because most people don't get A's and B's so the average of people not participating would be horrible!.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.151524929,<span style="color:white">0.8051886640000001</span>,0.0432864044]</span>
