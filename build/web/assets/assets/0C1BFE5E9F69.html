So I don't really think that is a good idea to make it were you have to have a "B" average in order to play some type of sport its crazy I think so anyways.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.061900208,<span style="color:white">0.8950745920000001</span>,0.043025185]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
