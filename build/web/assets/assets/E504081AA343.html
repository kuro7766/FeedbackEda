Dear, Principal</br></br><span style="color:orange">In many countries most children do not have a choose of whether or they want to up out the community. But, if u look at those children from other countries they are all responsible, and know how to act in public. Not saying all Americans are bad but, that we take things for granted.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.1430384742,<span style="color:white">0.8131828400000002</span>,0.0437786711999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I believe that children should do community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.082922401,<span style="color:white">0.891974694</span>,0.0251028872]</span>  <span style="color:orange">it can help them understand that not everything is easy but, that everything it is not just handed to you.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0637796228,<span style="color:white">0.889852408</span>,0.0463679325999999]</span>  Maybe i should go into details.</br></br><span style="color:orange">I go to school everyday and watch children act a fool and be disrespectful to their teachers.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0573073942,<span style="color:white">0.8990486799999999</span>,0.043643943]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So i think that it's because at home these children do not have anyone telling right from wrong but, not only that they have no responsibly at home. They all get away with to much and mostly come home play video games, get on Facebook, and thing like that. So maybe if the school help them understand that life isn't easy just maybe these children will be a bit better.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1322695048,<span style="color:white">0.81537466</span>,0.0523558581999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">With that said you can probably see how trilled I am to see schools try and make a difference in these kids life show them that the bad habits you have now you will mostly have later in life and not everyone going to put up with it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.11935164,<span style="color:white">0.837093802</span>,0.0435545487999999]</span>  <span style="color:white">Even thought I am with the idea i still have to put myself in their shoes because, some of these kids have seen stuff that I never plan on seeing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.57763439</span>,0.4168971939999999,0.00546841296]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also is this community service during school hours and if so don't you think it would be taking away from our learning time I mean responsible is great to have.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.133010934,<span style="color:white">0.8362280420000001</span>,0.0307610204]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It might not such a great thing if u do not know how to read, write or do simple math.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.37249002,<span style="color:white">0.62024502</span>,0.00726496006]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So I believe that children just need a little bit more responsible in their life to learn to make better choices.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.162446931,<span style="color:white">0.8255629039999999</span>,0.01199018514]</span> </br></br>Your Truly</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
