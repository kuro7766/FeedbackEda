Yes, it is very dangerest because of high temperature and pressure. But if we come up with a way to lower the temperature and pressure it will be surely worth the work put in. These reason are way we should try to visit Venus in the future.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0512184132,0.8415107159999999,<span style="color:white">0.1072708534</span>]</span>
