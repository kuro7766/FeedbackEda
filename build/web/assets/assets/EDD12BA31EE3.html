Venus is closer to the sun than Earth is withc can make it dangerous for it to be explored.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.228332606,<span style="color:white">0.7665338519999999</span>,0.0051335522]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In the past they have tried to explore it they have sent numerous spacecraft to land Venus.

It is a very challenging plant for humans to study. The atmosphere makes it even worse to travel through it being 97 persent carbon dioxide.

They also say that even though there are dangers here that means that we shouldn't stop what we are doing we keep pushing. They also say beacuse of doubts they shouldn't give up. If a spacecraft can't stay there for more than two hours then how do you explore it with out having risks.
