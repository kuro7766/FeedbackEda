Some people might be mad look upset because they donÃÂ´t feel like choosing one but am cool with it</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I agree about must participate in one extracurricular activity</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">I can make newer friends or the new comer can make new friends easier</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">it give us some thing to do while we wait until our parents comes home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br>First, sometime it is hard to make new friends you at i new school and nobody knows you and u feel alone. <span style="color:white">Your parents or teacher might say say hi and you might mike a new friend that half a lie to me it easier said then done.
