The Electoral College has a method of awarding electoral votes, inducucing the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. This is because voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, making it easier for the candidates to study what the certain states needs are and convincing them that if they vote for them, their needs will be met.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0638468943999999,0.432461724,<span style="color:white">0.50369138</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Some may say that the winner-take-all system isn't fair to some states because most of the candidates don't even bother going to the states that they know they have no chance in winning.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.01547084954,0.385921794,<span style="color:white">0.59860734</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Well this can be argued by saying that this method may help the candidates because if they know that they have no chance in winning in some states, they might specifically prepare a certain speech that may persuade the state to vote for them.

This means if the voter is from the south, they have no reason to campaign heavily in those sates. Instead they can spend more time in states that need a little more convincing fot the candidate to gain their vote. It also restores some of the weight in the political balance that a large states loses by virtue of the mal-appotrionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0782205248,0.488150616,<span style="color:white">0.433628823</span>]</span> .  <span style="color:yellow">Some may say that the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote is something to worry about.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.0295172647999999,0.5067899499999999,<span style="color:white">0.4636927659999998</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">But the Electoral College avoids the problem of there being a run-off election.

It isn't complicated and makes the election run more smoothly. It provides multiple ways for a candidate to win the vote of a certain state and avoids major problem during the election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0181342407799999,0.423245414,<span style="color:white">0.558620344</span>]</span>
