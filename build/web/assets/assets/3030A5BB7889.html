But I would go ahead and have them use their phones through out the day when they are not in classes. Like say it started snowing really bad at school that day and your coach tells you at school that there will be no practice after school. You could call or text your parent ahead of time during school that there is no practice. So it would be more efficient for you and your parent both. Your parent could go home earlier without having to wait for you after practice. I just think that it is important to have your phone at least when your not in class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1252620148,<span style="color:white">0.81958965</span>,0.0551483044]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">But sometimes it isn't good to have phones at all in school</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.197665176,<span style="color:white">0.796660704</span>,0.00567409294]</span> . <span style="color:white">Like say someone at your school got shot or maybe something very bad happened to someone and your texting and calling your parents, grandparents, friends, and other people about what had happened.
