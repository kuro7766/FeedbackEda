Not always." By this I mean, not letting him choose who ever he's going for. As in of showing that he took everyones vote and made them all count. Even if the guy he's going for wins the election, we can say it was fair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.319412474,<span style="color:white">0.652604564</span>,0.02798293614]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electoral College is not fair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.060499384,<span style="color:white">0.8642725199999999</span>,0.0752281091999999]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">First of all we don't know who picks the electors. We don't know if there truthful as in putting in votes. I'm sure they have to have certain requirments to become an elector but we are not the ones chosing them. In the 2000 campaign 17 states didn't even see the people running in the election. Also in an Electoral College ties exist so then it has to be thrown into the House of Represenatives where the delagations will vote on the president. Making our votes worthless because the people in the goverment get to chose whos next to become president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.17800103,0.686064518,<span style="color:white">0.135934459</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Popular vote is more accurate</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0578954948,<span style="color:white">0.8586717079999999</span>,0.083432828]</span> .
