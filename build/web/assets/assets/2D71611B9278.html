That would be a really cool thing to do at school. I think its a good idea asnd I am not going to argue about this suggestion. If you can walk into a classroom and you can tell if a child is happy, sad, confused or even just bored you will be able to know if they are okay. If a child is sad you can try and help them and out and see what is going on.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0699748432,<span style="color:white">0.908401662</span>,0.0216234986]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In the passage it says, "hold on, we can actually calculate emotions." well yes if you actually give it a try.

Maybe teachers can bump their classrooms up to funner and more satisfying things, because you will know if a kid is bored in your cass if they have that. It says that "each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)." Let's just try the facial action coding out and see where everything goes, but it seems like it's going to go good. I totally agree and I don't argue with this expirement.
