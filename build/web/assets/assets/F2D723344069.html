An argument that I have about Luke's point of view about the Seagoing Cowboys program is when the artical said, " <span style="color:orange">By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips, the most of any Seagoing Cowboy," and " It toook two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China".</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.3577782359999999,<span style="color:white">0.618451764</span>,0.0237700168]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Who would ever want to take that long overseas.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1910901068,<span style="color:white">0.768842434</span>,0.0400674672]</span> </br></br>Then, he also said,<span style="color:orange">" Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be cleaned".</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.216376234,<span style="color:white">0.7508538060000001</span>,0.0327699712]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I wouldn't want to work that hard overseas either.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.17350837,<span style="color:white">0.7880752979999999</span>,0.0384163364]</span> </br></br>Finally my last argument is when he said, " <span style="color:orange">On his second trip, Luke served as night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.496852534,<span style="color:white">0.475657724</span>,0.027489742]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Who would ever want to go through that and get broken ribs</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.190192026,<span style="color:white">0.76572312</span>,0.0440848666]</span> . <span style="color:white">That is my argument to not be a Seagoing Cowboy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.4709802728</span>,0.516289,0.0127307151]</span>
