<span style="color:orange">Would you want summer to be filled to the brim with boring assigments made by your teacher instead of enjoying some of your only time off school? If teachers were to construct summer projects they wouldn't be fun at all. Summer vacation is something to get excited for, not to dread.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0463685018,<span style="color:white">0.670279162</span>,0.283352334]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The teachers' projects would create anxiety for many but letting the students take the wheel could be interesting</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0312089493999999,<span style="color:white">0.7037713739999999</span>,0.265019655]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The students could think of projects to not only work their minds while on break</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0433666608,<span style="color:white">0.710795722</span>,0.2458376179999999]</span> , but also to <span style="color:orange">enjoy and appreciate what they've done.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1079633794,<span style="color:white">0.7186627440000001</span>,0.1733738689999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Teachers have a hard time giving work that is both challenging and rewarding</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0480512688,<span style="color:white">0.73675653</span>,0.2151921859999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If they make a fun assignment, it must be easy. This is true for the opposite: If the make a challenging assignment it's garenteed to be boring. If they let the students make the summer projects they might find a perfect blend of the two. They would make something that requires skill and also happens to be exciting to do.</br></br>The taachers' projects would for a fact bring anxiety and depression for a magority of people becasue summer is a time for them to relax and regroup. Some teachers may not understand this concept or try to pass it off as no big deal. Students know what it's like so they could create projects that don't feel overwelming or unfair. It could be a compremise between the students and the teachers to get done the things they need to.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2967328399999999,<span style="color:white">0.547699622</span>,0.1555675302]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Over the course of summer, the projects might be forgotten if the teachers were to make them because no one enjoys them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0467361168,<span style="color:white">0.673207446</span>,0.280056454]</span>  <span style="color:white">To ensure that the projects don't get lost, students would have to think of ideas that would make the projects a blast to get though.
