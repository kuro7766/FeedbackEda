It may have to do with where the president is from (North, South). This goes back to how the bigger states have more power.

This means that the bigger states in the South will be known for all voting Romney since that is where he is the strongest and well liked. There may be voters in the South that were more for Obama. Smaller states may hate what Romney is doing and vote for Obama, but they do not have as much power as the bigger states.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00438380366,0.0964920692,<span style="color:white">0.899124162</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">This is like the winner takes it all, they may know that they have no chance in winning.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0154713166999999,0.321524472,<span style="color:white">0.663004188</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">(Obama did end up winning and was titled as the 44th President of the United States.
