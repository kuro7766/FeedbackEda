<span style="color:yellow">Creativity is the heart of our current society, when given the opportunity those who have the ability to think outside the box create unimaginably beautiful things. In schools students arent given the opportunity to be as creative as they could be because of how restrictive and bland the projects and assignments made by teachers are. If our society depends on the creativity and skill set of the current generation in schools why not give them the opportunity to develop their skills and be able to flourish in their own success?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.001809449108,0.0956778392,<span style="color:white">0.90251271</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Which is why I think that summer projects should be student designed</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0415755664,<span style="color:white">0.556691996</span>,0.401732442]</span>  because <span style="color:yellow">its helps students learn to become more creative</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0049073372,0.279617954,<span style="color:white">0.715474708</span>]</span>  and <span style="color:yellow">helps prepare them for the future.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00520479522,0.284060512,<span style="color:white">0.71073469</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Students usually spend their summer either sleeping or just having fun with their friends trying to make the most out of the break but as students reach high schools they find that they have to do projects over the summer.

Students dont tend to learn anything new over the summer since they are focused on their break and enjoying it as much as possible but doing a project that takes time and interests them helps them learn what goes into making a project and what the requirements are. This helps students to use their new found abilities in the workplace to much more easily express their creativity since they now know the tools to show it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0068796519,0.193813956,<span style="color:white">0.799306394</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">When teachers make summer projects for students it makes it harder for a student to care about the project because they didnt really have a part in making it, so if the teachers decide on making a project based on a topic a student doesnt like they wouldnt be as interested.

If teachers give students the opportunity to design their own project then they would be teaching more than the class but skills they can use in the future as well. Since creativity is the backbone of everything in the world when teachers start to make new ideas to have students think more creatively it helps the development of new ideas and innovations in the future.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.003389796,0.174451869,<span style="color:white">0.822158368</span>]</span>
