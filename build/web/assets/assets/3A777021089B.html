An example could be if you're on a football team your teammates become your friends and that gives you a whole community of people who care about you. It doesn't even have to be a team it could even be a group that likes horses, but they still have something in common to bond over.

Many students might not fit in to friend groups, but with after school clubs they know they have similarities with their peers. It's a great way to relive stress with the people you care about while doing something you care about</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">That's why I think that having everyone participate in a club or sport could be very beneficial for these reasons, and I think it's a great addition to our school systems.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>
