If they had to do community service after school then they would miss there game or practice. <span style="color:orange">Like everyone says "practice makes perfect" and if the kids doing sports don't practice they will get worse at the sport and wont ever exceed. The coach might not have many players and if half of his kids are doing community service he will have to forfeit the game. There is one reason why students shouldn't have to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.156108158,<span style="color:white">0.783753602</span>,0.0601382464]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Every kid does community service every day without even knowing that they are doing it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1437654148,<span style="color:white">0.8090535899999999</span>,0.0471809795999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">if they play sports, they are doing community service. Also if they help someone out they are doing community service. Finally the students are doing community service just by showing up to school. That is just one more reason why the students shouldn't have to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.20246573,<span style="color:white">0.7509766319999999</span>,0.0465576532]</span> </br></br>Finally the students should only do community service if they do something bad. <span style="color:orange">Like i said before, students do community service all the time without even knowing they are doing it. Most of the kids that do bad stuff just laugh at the punishments the school gives now. So if they were doing community service it would waste there time and if one of there friends saw them they would be embarrassed. There is the third reason why students shouldn't have to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.294455228,<span style="color:white">0.6675812999999999</span>,0.037963472]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Community service shouldn't be required for students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.077723935,<span style="color:white">0.8338263940000001</span>,0.0884496726]</span>  Only the bad kids should have to do community service. Every kid does community service without knowing they are. A lot of kids play sports and would have to miss them to do the community service. That is why students shouldn't have to do community service.
