<span style="color:orange">I am for the value of this technollogy to read students emotional expressions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">To start off with I think this would be a. good idea because it says in the article "for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by just simply by the look on there face." This proves you can probably tell how one of your friends are feeling by just a expression on there face but my point is this that the technollogy can tell what emotions youtr friend is actually feeling</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">This would be helpful because sometimes you ask a friend what is wrong and they just say nothing but you know something is wrong by the way they are acting and this technollogy will help with that because and can tell what emotions they re actuallyu feeling</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In addition, this technoollogy would also be a positive because you can know when anyone is happy,sad or frustrated</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">For example it says in the article "imagine a computer that knows when your happy or sad. For exampe, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow, but if yyou frown, the next ad will be different.'' This shows that you can tell how someone is feeling just based on if they smile or frown.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Personally I am against this because I would love to know what everyone is feeling if they asre my frien oir not and know the real reason why they are acting the way they are no matter if they are sad or happy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, I am for this technollogy to read students emotinoal feelings because i would like to know how everyone is feeling and acting the way they are. For instance, what if it is a friendand no matter how close you are they will not t ell you if they are upset or happy and if you had this technollogy you could tell what they are feeling because they could lie and say they are not feeling anything which then this technollogy could then help with that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
