Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">The Electoral college can be greatly described as a pedigree. The Electoral College being around for so long as the time of our founding fathers- quite a long time, now having doubts? "The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anaschornism,". Can't say that anyone shouldn't be surprised just like anything in this life everything comes to an end at some point</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0652931858,0.6189247979999999,<span style="color:white">0.315782024</span>]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Agreed that it is unfair something like the Electoral College to be around especially in this era, it craves more rights than it feels it's been restricted from</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0796436354,<span style="color:white">0.74066091</span>,0.1796954466]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Yes, it has a history that truly lights the room of American development, but already many things from the government have changed, Would it really hurt to change the Electoral College?</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.065959465,<span style="color:white">0.71288365</span>,0.221156866]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">America has always been about the people?

Although their hasn't been numerous situations in which the Electoral College vote will dosen't win the national popular vote...It still happened and also a possibility that it can happen again! Why have two different types of votes when you can easily have one vote? "The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population)" the vote is America broken in one whole breaking up the population in each state, which is equivalent to breaking us up in 13 colonies. We should be considered one!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1067771689999999,<span style="color:white">0.548921056</span>,0.344301778]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">"The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November."
