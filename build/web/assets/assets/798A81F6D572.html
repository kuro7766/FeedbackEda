Community Service</br></br>By: STUDENT_NAME</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that students should perform a community service because it would make our community stronger and bring us closer together in the things we do</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Some things we could do are cleaning up liter and making our Earth healthier.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also we can throw our garbage away instead of throwing it in the streets or on the sidewalk and if we see a person do it, we could tell them to pick it up and throw it out or we can throw it out for them if they don't throw it away.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Another thing is our community can make a garden and plant vegetables, trees, flowers and other things</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">We can do that for helping families in need and we can actually help them too</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . Also, <span style="color:orange">we could recycle our paper, cans, and cell phones or ink cartages.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If everyone recycles, our Earth would be a lot cleaner and we wouldn't have to worry about having a dirty Earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Our community can also donate to homeless families and families that live in shelters and that would need things for their family or themselves.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">We can give them things like, clothes, toys, food, make up, blankets/sheets and other things a person would need. Everyone needs someone to take care of them and look out for them and they always will need someone there.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The community we live in could be a lot stronger and healthier if we all just try together.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>  It takes a lot more than one person. It takes hundreds. If we just try it together, it'll work.
