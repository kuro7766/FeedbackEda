Dear Florida State Senator</br></br><span style="color:orange">With all do respect i dont think having the electoral college is a proper way to nominate a president, or any senate for our country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">i strongly agree that we should have the idea of changing it to election by popularity.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">to be known as a good person or a good citizen in your state or anywhere you have to be a great rolemodel & an excellent example to our world. From what i discovered in a passage electoral college is unfair.</br></br>who are the electors ? and who picks out the electors ? it dependes on the state. voters sometimes vote for there electores but sometimes the voters get confused on who they voted on. somtimes the wrong candiate.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">yes i do think that people who are running for president and senate should have the right to have a chance to become something big, but in my perspective i think that peoiple who is known and well common to there state will be a better outcome to whatever they run for</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:white">its like for an example, we live in the Florida state , we've know a woderful and handsome man that helps around our state and town of plant city,  giving us more and devoring most of his time helping the enviroment and creating a diffrence. The man would have a greater chance of being nomitanted to being a president unlike the other man who only came out of his shell a year ago and have no idea what this man is capable of. Who will we have better trust on?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">When you win a contest or a bet we usally get what we accomplished for, when a elector wins , it takes all. well only the electoral collge works up on this. so please state senator, please change the process on how we are voting now, i think it would be alot more acceptable to vote on a preident on popularity. The united sates wants to be in the hands of a trusted person and someone the whole world can look upond.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
