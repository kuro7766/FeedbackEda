<span style="color:yellow">The President of the United States is currently determined by an electoral college. The electoral college process involves the public voting for their elector and not the main focus, the candidates. Through this, many of the states gain more power than they should, and the votes are set up as a "Winner-takes-all" system.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.00450075936,0.139461336,<span style="color:white">0.8560378820000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">This unneccessary and inaccurate use of votes is outdated and needs to be shut down.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0071493889599999,0.237634274,<span style="color:white">0.7552163479999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">In an instant, an electoral college voter could change his or her mind and go against his or her original political party.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0075324690199999,0.22610703,<span style="color:white">0.7663605359999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This is a completely unfair use of power because it reverses all of the votes that went to the elector and to all of the voters who were counting on the elector to properly represent their vote.
