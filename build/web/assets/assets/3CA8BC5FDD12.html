In sports you have to have the equipment your so pose to have for that sport. It could be Baseball, Football, Basketball or Soccer and whatever sport there is chosen for that student. Most sports you have to do conditioning so you have to run a lot and some people don't like running. Some people are not athletic and there just not good enough for sports. They might want to have a job and trying to go for what they want to do later in life. A lot of sports you can get seriously injured and some students might not want that to happen to them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.316707288,<span style="color:white">0.6745606420000001</span>,0.0087320417]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">What is wrong with the yearbook.
