<span style="color:yellow">Imagine the following scenario: you wake up in the morning and there is two feet of snow on the ground. You turn on the television and your local news station reports that your school is closed today, so rather than spending a wasteful snow day doing nothing and having to make up seat time later in the year, you log onto your computer and connect with your teachers and classmates via video chat. In many schools in the United States, this situation is quite common. As technology becomes readily available to more and more people, some schools offer the option for students to learn without being at school by way of the Internet. Those who oppose online school argue that technology is harmful to learning and that the best learning environment is the classroom. While it is ideal that the student be in the classroom, sometimes technology is helpful when the student cannot physically attend class</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.000542094336,0.0399672162,<span style="color:white">0.959490698</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">It is imperative that people abandon their old fashioned ideas about technology and school and recognize the benefits that online school may provide.

When school is canceled for more than a few days, holidays become regular school days, and sometimes students have to attend extra days in the summer to make up for the lost seat time. Furthermore, sometimes driving buses after a severe weather event can be hazardous due to debris or ice lingering on roadways, even once school is back in session. Online school eliminates these issues with school wide cancellations because the student can simply attend classes at home no matter the weather.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00061933353,0.0473053086,<span style="color:white">0.952075364</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Online school may benefit students that have conditions preventing them from coming to school.

Technology is the solution to wasteful missed school days caused by severe weather, health, and home conditions. Students can get around the things that hinder them from achieving success in school by attending classes online. Of course, the goal of every institution is to make sure that their students receive the information they need for their future so they thrive, so it is absurd that anyone would put down the idea of online school. In fact, technology connects people to one another. The world is constantly growing and changing in terms of technology, so why should our schools be any different?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.00070763004,0.0505422738,<span style="color:white">0.948750112</span>]</span>
