For starters if technology will be able to read kids expressions while learning and being in class for teachers there will be one very good benifit. " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" Dr. Huang predicts this is going to be a very good thing for teachers, because teachers will be able to know what a kid is feeling this means that the teach will no longer have to keep going over the same information with the same kids just because one kid does not understrand it or isnt paying attention.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0727126147999999,<span style="color:white">0.86368782</span>,0.0635995358]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The teacher can focus on those targeted students spicificly, and not have to go over the same information multiply times.
