it is best to make a call yourself to do what is best for you.</br></br>If you cannot learn to make choices for yourself early it is going to be even harder when you are in the real world and have to make a lot of tough calls.</br></br>When you get advice from one person then it is almost always going to be a one sided idea or piece of advice.</br></br>When you come to a road block on your own path then that is when you need to ask for advice.</br></br>It is never good to ask just one person.</br></br>So as soon as you get many pieces of advice and most of them state the same thing it is probably the best one.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0779343044,<span style="color:white">0.523848572</span>,0.3982171052]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If you

want to do or how you can convince your parents to let you do the sport that you want to do.</br></br>The best way to get better at sports is to seek advice from people who have played it for a long time.</br></br>Most sports like basketball or wrestling are just experience dominates.</br></br>In basketball if you are guarding someone with a lot of experience then it is going to be a lot harder because they already know the sport like the back of their hand.</br></br>It is always the best to seek advice from older players.</br></br>Because they have played the sport longer than you have and
