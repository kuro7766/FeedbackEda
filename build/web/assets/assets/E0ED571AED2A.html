Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I am aware that you are aware that some kids from our school are debating wether to do community service or not. I would highly encourage you to help these boys see the benefit in doing this. I know for a fact that I am doing this to better our community and our school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I don't recommend that you should require kids to do this I'm just saying that you should get kids who want to help, come and help.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I believe that kids in 7th to 12th grade should learn how to do service</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">When people hear the words Community Service I believe that they think of being in trouble (some times it is getting in trouble).</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  I don't how to put this TEACHER_NAME but <span style="color:orange">l think that by doing a good service to the community will be good to our school, especially friends, and families that help serve in the community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I believe that the people who work in the police department and as the fire squad should have a day off once every two months so that kids that are my age can help out too. I would advise you to help kids get in the act in helping, there's kids out there that know how to help but they just refuse to help.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">lf you know what I'm saying then you should help me get friends to do this with me and hopefully some of the people in my ward.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Thanks for your time and have a great day!</br></br>Sincerely your fellow student at this school</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
