<span style="color:white">I dont think there will ever be a 100% driverless car i think there will alway be a person with some what controll or should be at all time even in a car that has all the most advanced driverless tecnlogty. i think the need for a humman is needed at all times becaus that tecnlogy wiil fail and if ther is one driverless car on a highway and the human is not in controll and if it was to mess up it could kill a lot of inacent people. but my personal opion is if there are a few driverless cars cool use them at spechel event like the daytona 500,award ceremoneys, in honering someone and things like that..... i think i would be a bad idea to make them avalible to the public for many reasons some being when they mess up how many people will get hurt and when theyn sell them only rich people will be able to afford them because the tecnlogy will be so advanced and cost so munch and the incerence will cost a fortune and when they fail and if they are able to fix them who and how munch will it cost to fix. if people are to lazy to drive them selves then we have a problem</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.797717044</span>,0.197788732,0.00449424044]</span>  <span style="color:orange">yeah ot would be cool to have a couple driverless cars in the country but not to make multipule</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.211514842,<span style="color:white">0.7806647800000001</span>,0.00782039956]</span>  and <span style="color:white">im not sure how may people would buy themi would not like not being in controll of what my car is doing .</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.302697666</span>,0.6912857419999999,0.00601658486]</span>  and that are some of the reasons i think makeing multipule driverless cars would be a bad idea
