So i think the principal should change the rules and let us use are phones. Also so students don't use them in class teachers should collect the students phones before class starts and give it back when class is over so students will not use them in class or just turn them off and show the teacher.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.2744414679999999</span>,0.722091508,0.0034670393199999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Other reasons students should use there phones is because they can call somebody is an emergency happens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0730246108,<span style="color:white">0.92246715</span>,0.00450821042]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also they can call 911 is something really bad happens</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1325977108,<span style="color:white">0.864917908</span>,0.0024843717]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Another thing is they will enjoy coming to school and have a smile</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.155671298,<span style="color:white">0.840887824</span>,0.00344087168]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I think people will enjoy the new rule if it changed and be happy to use there phones in school.
