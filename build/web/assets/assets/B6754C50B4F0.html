Dear, TEACHER_NAME</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think there should be changes because people like to stay in fit and some people that can't join sports do other things that are bad for them</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">Students think that we should stop wearing uniforms because they are not cool like other clothes. I think its a bad idea because if we stop wearing uniforms then people are to wear inappropriate clothes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Students like me prefer more stuff like sports better food and other stuff but if we don't do good in school we don't deserve nothing like that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">That's what I think but other people don't.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I think we should have more exciting sports and more stuff that girls can do</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">like cheer leading a lot of girls like doing that to support our school when the kids in basketball when they have a game. I think cheer leading is awesome because we can do exciting moves and we can meet more people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There is some other pretty cool sports like tennis, or kick ball, or baseball is cool to.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When we have sports like that people stay out of trouble more.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">The sports that I like more is tennis because I like hitting stuff and i like to play with other people. People join basketball soccer more then the other sports.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">This is the reasons why I think we should have more sports and more activities for us to play more and so we can help our school be better</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> <span style="color:white">. I think there should be a cleaning group because if we do that then our school will be cleaner and it will help out the janitors more.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>I think this is a awesome idea.</br></br>sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
