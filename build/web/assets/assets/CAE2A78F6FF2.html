<span style="color:yellow">The Electoral College is used in the United States to elect a president, yet it is higly debated over whether it is needed or not. The Electoral College was founded to compromise the election of a president between the people and Congress, to try to avoid problems between both parties. Many people allign themselves with one side to argue that it is needed to eliminate unfair advantages, or that it is not needed because it doesn't give the people the power to elect their president. This brings up disputes and controversy especially in situations that give evidence to support both cases, such as the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George Bush.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.000696377964,0.0428468446,<span style="color:white">0.956456796</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The Electoral College should be kept in use</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.00490034516,<span style="color:white">0.224282534</span>,0.7708171199999999]</span>  because <span style="color:yellow">it provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00152898142,0.1183387983999999,<span style="color:white">0.8801322340000001</span>]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00159474148,0.12067009,<span style="color:white">0.8777351719999998</span>]</span> , and <span style="color:yellow">avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00163959004,0.1213875027999999,<span style="color:white">0.8769729740000001</span>]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:yellow">To begin with, the Electoral College should be in use because it provides fair representation for all the states involved in the election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00102400747,0.086989534,<span style="color:white">0.911986474</span>]</span>  "<span style="color:yellow">The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal." "This is a desireable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president." This shows that it is beneficial because it makes a candidate who has only regional appeal, have to work harder in other states to show that he would be fair to all states, not just the ones that support him. Furthermore, it allows for massive regional advantages, like the South, mean nothing because they would still have to convince the North to vote for them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000789855788,0.045825212,<span style="color:white">0.953384914</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The opposing side might argue that if a candidate has regional appeal, they should just let that win them the election</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.0027383863399999,0.145627918,<span style="color:white">0.8516336800000002</span>]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">but a successful president should be able to sway the whole country into voting for him, not just a certain region.

This all shows that fewer problems arise when using this procedure, rather than if they use majority vote. "You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors." This shows that the citizens still have power in choosing their candidate and it creates a balance with other parties. In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept to preserve the integrity and equality the United States is all about.
