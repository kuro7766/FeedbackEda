dear principal,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I do not think that students should be required to perform community service. I do think that it should be highly recommended though.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I think it should be recommended and not forced because some students actually do not have the time to perform community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Say your friend was on the school basketball team and he was part of the Spanish honor society, school would end at three he would have to go to a Spanish honor society meeting from three until four thirty then he would need a to do his homework for two hours then he would have a basketball game at six, then he would need to eat dinner when he got home and eight thirty and by then he would be too exhausted to even move let alone perform community service and he would have to repeat this every day until the weekend which he will need to sleep and do homework and also relax from a tough week</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">on the other hand there are the people who go home blow off their homework and either hang out with friends or play video games,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">that is why I would highly recommend community service instead of forcing it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:yellow">it would be unfair if the people who are working constantly their whole week have to then perform community service after their long and hard week behind and a new one imminently coming. while it is completely fair for the slacking and un working people to take time out of their day to help their community</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span>  from, a student
