The Constitution states that we are able to vote for our president, but then what do you call this? This is not an example of what America stands for, and this is certainly not the voting system that is described by our nation's properties. There is another issue with this violation of rights concerning our voting system, it's how the Electoral College votes and how dependable they are. The article "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong." talks about how you can't control who the electorals you chose vote for. "Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always." This statement helps prove that the president you may want may not even get you vote. The Electoral College not only takes away your right to assuringly vote for the president of your choice, but it also takes away right personal voting right as an American. Don't let someone else detain your freedom of speech, let you personal voice be heard by the people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0018939547599999,0.0389960432,<span style="color:white">0.959109986</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">While the Electoral College may seem like a sure fire way to assure that we get a president, that doesn't really mean the majority wants that president. Think about it, we don't always get the president we voted for. Popular vote doesn't really matter, it's like saying you voice doesn't matter to the government.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00239318632,0.104493949,<span style="color:white">0.8931128559999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">They took away the right as an American they gave you in the first place. Popular vote should replace the Electoral College. There have been instances where the popular vote reined supreme, but the Electoral College didn't agree. In the article, "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" it mentions an election where Al Gore lost even though he won the popular vote. "...according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency..." This helps show the people that it seems our vote isn't what is truly important, it's only what the Electoral College does that makes a true impact on choosing of president for the next two years. It's even stated in the very same article that, "...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now." If our vote truly matters then why not vote on keeping the Electoral College in play or getting rid of the flawed system once and for all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0154170631,0.111625561,<span style="color:white">0.8729573860000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electoral college is claimed to keep the voting system in line and prevent major mess, however this is not truly the case.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0073419861599999,<span style="color:white">0.225653554</span>,0.767004436]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There will still be flaws, but this is not the correct way to fix it.
