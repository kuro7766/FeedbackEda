The disaster factor is a strong argument against the Electoral College. Consider 1960, when Louisiana segregationists came close to replacing Democratic electors with ones who wouldn't support Kennedy (11). Also along those lines, electors are bound by nothing but obligation to vote for the candidate of their party, and sometimes change their decision upon voting. Even if it only happens occassionally, it is yet another fault in this system.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Not only is the Electoral College irrational, it is also simply unfair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Each state can only cast a single vote, so the one representative in Wyoming, who represents only 500 thousand, would have as much say as California's 55 representatives, who represent 35 million voters (12).</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Other sources say a tie would be unlikely.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">However, in 1979 in Ohio, it would have only taken a few thousand voters to vote the other way (12).</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Because of the "winner-take-all" system, certain states are left untouched by candidates who know they won't win them.

The Electoral College doesn't deserve its defenders. 2000 proved it, the voters have spoken up, and it is indisputably irrational to continue to rely on it. The system has been around for a while, and it will stay in place for the next few years, most likely. However, because of the light now being shined on its faults, it could have a chance to be reformed for the better.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective]</span>
