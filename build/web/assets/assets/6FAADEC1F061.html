Some countries created days dedicated to not driving cars, and if someone violated this, they would be fined. Some people accepted this and embraced it, while others did not like the idea of not being able to drive at all. That was why when Paris forced a driving ban, almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to the article "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer.
