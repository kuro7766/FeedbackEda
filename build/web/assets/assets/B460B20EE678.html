As human studies, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Humans study more and more about Venus everyday.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The Evening Star give us the brightest light because it's too close to the Earth. Venus has more power of light than other planet. Mercury is closer to the sun but Venus can get more power than Mercury. Venus has has more power to gets the hotness. Venus is vantage point of Earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The author says, "Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely," (paragraph 1).</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">As human studies, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. As humans study, Venus's atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our town. When Venus has low power of hotness, the weather on Earth has changed. The author said, "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus," (paragraph 3).</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Today, solar systems are useful on Earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Today, we're using computers, cell phone or tablat with solar. The author says, "By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces," (paragraph 7). Humans are still working on Venus to get more powers, even though we got lots of power from Venus already.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Humans didn't want Venus's power at first because it's too hot and now, they want it because it's safe. In the paragraph 8, the last line, it said "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation".</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span>
