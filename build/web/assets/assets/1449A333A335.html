However, if the projects were student-designed, they would be more likely to complete them since they designed them themselves. These projects would make the students use their creativity, which would lead to more of them expressing their interests. They will be much more motivated to do a project that interests them than a project made and given to them by a teacher.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Many students travel and have plans over the summer.
