To explain what the Electoral College is, the Office of the Federal Register writes</br></br>What is the Electoral College?.</br></br>Bradford Plumer writes</br></br>The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, to explain the problems with the Electoral College, and lastly, Richard A.
