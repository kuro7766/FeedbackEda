So you can see if you can fix it. Another reason why i think its a good thing is because it tell the peron your doing it to and you how there expressions are. I also fill like this could be a good thing because if the person is going threw a hard point in their life then this would be good. The reson why this could be good is because then you could help them out before they do anything to them self. another thing that this would be good for is if you r going to go do something and the other person has a expression on there face you cant tell how they feel about it then yoiu can use this technology to see if it bothers them or not. There was a claim in the story that they figured how the person felt before doing something.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.294444206</span>,0.6935165660000001,0.0120392468]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Now, there is some reasons i think this could be bad.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.329756524,<span style="color:white">0.668428892</span>,0.0018145878699999]</span>  <span style="color:white">I think it could be bad because the parents of the kid or the kid himself may not like you doing this sort of thing on him. This is why im kinda on both sides because if they wont done to them I could understand that so thats why i think its fine to not do it if you don't want to. They might not want you to because they might just not want you to know about some of there personal life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.457058166</span>,0.540614932,0.002326895112]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, these are some of the reasons why i think it should be a thing and some of the reasons why i think it shouldn't be a thing.
