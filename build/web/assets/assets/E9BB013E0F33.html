It also could be the gravitation pull of the Earth. I think that you should believe that is not aliens because if it was aliens dont you thinl they would be doing more than just that? That means if it reall the aliens who made this they must have a lot of thinking and knowledge about stuff like that. That also means that when earth moves the face moves with the Earth.

People that go to Mars have to be very brave and other things too. the camera has taken pictures because it has to have proof that it really does look like a face. I think again that it is just a landform that has been made over the pass years by the gratational pull and Earths winds.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
