Movement of one or more muscles is called an "action unit. Then his friend Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FAC (Facial Action Coding). Dr Huang then observed that "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.533997104</span>,0.4604433699999999,0.0055595191399999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">By using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks the facial movements in either or real face or painted picture of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions, each expression is compared against a neutral face.
