Moth, famine, and thieves destroy here. But riches in heaven is what matters. This country would never even have became independent if it was run by the people who are running it now.

They want us to have a "holiday" party instead. they will all see one day. On judgment day. All we can do is pray for them because thats all that can help these distranged men.
