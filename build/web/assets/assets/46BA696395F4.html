<span style="color:orange">My thoughts on the google driverless car is simple. Once they are truly able to be autonomus and safe then you can put them out on the streets.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0777629848,<span style="color:white">0.860984038</span>,0.0612529897999999]</span>  So as of right now <span style="color:orange">I think that they should not be on the streets.

The car company will come out on top though; the big name car company will fight so hard that they will get a bill passed that bans all humans from driving!</br></br>This is also a reason that I am not for driverless cars.

Or maybe we are to prepared for this.</br></br><span style="color:orange">In this society hackers are becoming more and more dangerous. I know these autonomus cars will have to have google maps or be connceted to some kind of network. What happens when cars start getting hacked and maipulated what do we do about?

When you are in the car you could truly connect with the people inside. Long trips would turn into exiting family times.

You have to consider what the majority of the people want. I know that many people will like this idea. My generation would be all over this, we are just a bunch of lazy tech heads. I think that self driving cars will connect with many people.
