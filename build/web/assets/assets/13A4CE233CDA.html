That way they can just reply to their friends when class is over or if the class is having free time they can talk to their friends. Many students say they are going to the library to get a book when they get any book they put the phone in the book and do whatever. That is wasting their time and someone who actually wants to read the book. They think the book is being used for good things when its not.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.240754584,<span style="color:white">0.7435512020000001</span>,0.0156942149]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">If the school is trying to change the police they should think of the good things and bad things that would happen.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.601644624</span>,0.397122518,0.00123287138]</span>
