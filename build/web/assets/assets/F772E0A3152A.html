<span style="color:yellow">People in the United states have a voice of opinion towards voting,but in the end it is the electoral college that has the final say. To many americans voting is a very important event. The united states is a democracy. A democracy is a form of government where people have the say, The United States does not follow that route because of electoral college. Senator of the United States,</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I ask that you put a stop to the electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">First of all, I believe that The United States is a corrupted democracy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">The electoral college is a unbeneficial way of voting because they may be bias towards the people, for example, one might know what another so it can be considered as favoritism. In a sense this voting system can be manipulated in ones favor. How the voting system works is considered wrong to many Americans.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Workers in politics such as Richard Nixon or Jimmy Carter also do not believe in the electoral college and they even wanted to get rid of them!</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Most people want to get rid of the electoral college because of the "winner take all' system. If it wasnt for the winner take all system George W. Bush would of never been elected as president while john kerry would've taken the spot. Many politicians believe ingetting rid of the electoral college such as Bob Dole when he said "abolish the electoral college!"</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">In conclusion Senate, Citizens of this country and I believe that we should put an end to the electoral college. Politicians even disagree with the idea of giving specific people to give the final vote. As senator you have the power to put a end to this unconstitutional doing. The United States is a democracy where everyone matters. Because of the electoral college our opinion on who should be elected has been taking away from us. this event is undemocratic and I ask you senator to think this through and take action on making this voting system to a popular voting system</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective]</span> .Â
