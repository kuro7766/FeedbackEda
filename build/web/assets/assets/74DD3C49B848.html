Dear Mr. Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Around my community, there has been a lot of talk about how the president should be elected into office. Whether it is from the electorial college or by popular vote. This is a very important matter to me because it can change how our country is.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.1582613611999999,<span style="color:white">0.765228282</span>,0.076510333]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In my opinion, it should be by the electorial college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.1137872747999999,<span style="color:white">0.8493610480000001</span>,0.0368516726]</span>  I'm not saying the elctorial college is the right way but I would really like if you can look into it.</br></br>My question to you Mr. senator is <span style="color:white">why you wouldnt want to take the process of the electorial college to pick a president? All of the pieces seem to fall into place. So isnt it the obvious choice?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.468452742</span>,0.5251533480000001,0.00639389108]</span>  See, <span style="color:orange">the person who gets the most ammount of votes gets to be the president. Thats as simple as it can get. And in my opinion, it is as fair as it gets.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.108865943,<span style="color:white">0.8170709760000001</span>,0.0740630834]</span>  <span style="color:white">It is also not a democratic method of selecting the next person in office.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.263535234</span>,0.71537572,0.0210890639999999]</span> </br></br>So Mr. Senator, all i want you to do is <span style="color:white">look into the elctoral college. It is obviously the right choice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.3590895672</span>,0.6318322359999999,0.0090781937199999]</span>  So please, make the whole community happier and use the better way.
