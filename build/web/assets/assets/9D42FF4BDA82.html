<span style="color:white">Venus id the closes planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distamce too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other times to Venis. Bacause Venus is somentimes right atound the corner- in space terms-humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world.</br></br>A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's armosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures averga over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times grater than what we experience on our own planet.</br></br>The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furhermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames os space travel.</br></br>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularle compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.</br></br>More impotantntly, researchers cannot take samples of rock,gas, or anyrhing else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges.</br></br>NASA is working on other aproaches to studying Venus, For example, some simplified electronics the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war ll. Modern computers are enormouslt powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicated when it phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Strivind to meet the callenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
