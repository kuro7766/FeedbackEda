Dear State Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I read all these articles about some states having to vote for the president's electors. They say basically when your voting for a president, your voting for his/hers electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.20081017,<span style="color:white">0.7860068379999999</span>,0.0131830241999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">My opinion is there should be no need for electors. It should be easy and not too complicated. A presdient, a vice president, and a secatary. No electors or nothing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.1297476564,<span style="color:white">0.836882248</span>,0.0333700828]</span>  <span style="color:white">I think a president can do alot of his own work and think of ideas alone. If he need help than instead of us wasting our time with voting for people to give the presdient ideas and help him out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.413490996</span>,0.57567715,0.0108318661]</span>  <span style="color:white">Well the President always say's God Bless America. Shouldn't the President be listening to the voices of his country. America</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.664530108</span>,0.3334132939999999,0.0020565887]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Yes, I think the candidate with the most votes should win</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1643223899999999,<span style="color:white">0.82477108</span>,0.01090654554]</span> . <span style="color:white">But, If they say that their going to do something for our country than they need to keep their word. Make it a better place not for himslef but for everyone. For instance, Barack Obama. What's the need for this unessarcy work that he has done. America is loosing their mind and doesnt know what's going on. Why is he doing this?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.7915762519999999</span>,0.206110112,0.0023136508459999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The president is to make smart decent relevant choices. And if he listen to the voices of Americans than he would have lots of ideas lots!</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.282180154,<span style="color:white">0.701657962</span>,0.01616188998]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Instead he listens to who? His electors. People complain saying to themselfs, Where does he come up with these ideas? Well if you payed close attention to the presidents background and know what he really wants to do than you would know why. Honestly to me I dont think the Electoral College should keep going its just a bunch of mess that just doesnt make sence</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.485475946,<span style="color:white">0.508332724</span>,0.00619133956]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Elelctors dont matter to most American's. Take the electors and the Electoral College away we dont want something we dont need. All we need is a President, a Vice Presdient, and a Secatary.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.256641232,<span style="color:white">0.733227922</span>,0.0101308546]</span> </br></br>Sencerely, America
