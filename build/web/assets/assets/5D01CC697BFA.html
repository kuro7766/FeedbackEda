We have dicovered that the pictures look like a face on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">We can garentee that "aliens" did not do this.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">From the data we collected it seems to be that Mars was having formations and the ground/rocks looked like it had shadowed a face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Over the years as you can tell in the pictures the face begins to form into something different. The "Face" is starting to not look like a face anymore.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">If there were life on Mars they would try to keep the form from changing, right?</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Yes we know what you are thinking, "That cant be Mars doing that," but we have not collected any data of any sign of life on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">We have no reason to believe that Mars has any life form of any kind on it.
