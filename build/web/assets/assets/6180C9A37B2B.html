Dear principle,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think it is a good idea to make students do some community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0338122584,<span style="color:white">0.6432950820000001</span>,0.322892684]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some people around here need help and if we do this we could help very many families around the state.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0309676421999999,<span style="color:white">0.5107399880000001</span>,0.458292376]</span>  <span style="color:white">After school at least 3 times a week we can help a family or person in need.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.2195391752</span>,0.709475196,0.0709856198]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Kids think that doing this is stupid and they shouldn't have to,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.2287994292,<span style="color:white">0.702364252</span>,0.0688363189999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but we all need to step up and help out the community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.100844422,<span style="color:white">0.761840024</span>,0.1373155515999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">We could give away toys, clothes, and anything else we don't want, don't need, or could be helpful to someone else. Or we could send out ten people to go to every school in the county and read books to people in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade. Some of us can work in a soup kitchen whenever they are free.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0432496498,<span style="color:white">0.4761948940000001</span>,0.480555462]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Maybe sometime we can have an assembly at our school and we can hire a public speaker to tell us about how helping the community can help us and everyone else! This could be a great idea. And remember it only takes a few people to make a difference!</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.085187008,<span style="color:white">0.6635777540000001</span>,0.251235256]</span>  Thank you and have a great day!</br></br>sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
