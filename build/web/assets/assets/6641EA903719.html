Dear, principal</br></br><span style="color:orange">Some of the other students and I do not think that it is fair for you to acquire all of the students to do community service without us accepting.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For example some of the other students parents may not allow their kids to do community service because they probably have chores at home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The student may have a younger sibling and may have to watch them after school or during the weekend.</br></br>Other possibilities is that the students may have another job for extra money like babysitting or the student may have a lot of things on his mind such as projects for school or something and may be more focused on that than the community service itself.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Some of the students may not feel responsible enough for it and may think he wont do good enough or they will fail the task.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I also think that the students will want to choose if they want to do community service or not</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">i know that you especially don't want the students to go on strike and skip class on to go on strike against the principle of our school and get suspended or expelled or anything like that. Also if you could make an announcement about doing something else like help out or give some new ideas for our school like school dances or a fundraiser for our school and get new school supplies for our budget and everything like that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I hope this letter has changed your mind on making the school do community service and let kids choose if they want to or not</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>  and if you don't change your mind we will just accept what we have to do.</br></br>Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
