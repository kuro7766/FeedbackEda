It has the rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, craters. NASA is working to keep studying Venus.

They also didn't think about how fast the computers we have today would be. But they also said that just imagine exposing a cell phone, tablet to acid, or heat compatible of a metling tin, that must be what the heat is like on Venus. And since they can't be on Venus just orbiting or hovering safely they can't get the samples that they want from that distance.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.610753676,<span style="color:white">0.3859145579999999</span>,0.0033317623999999]</span>
