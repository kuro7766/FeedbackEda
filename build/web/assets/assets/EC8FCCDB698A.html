<span style="color:white">Venus is worth studying</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span>  because <span style="color:white">when they study it they called it an "Evening Star" also a "twin" of earth</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">It's the closest planet to earth, It is the closest in distence as well. Venus also has a 97% carbon diocide blanket, but on the surface its 800 degrees Fahrenheight.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  Since <span style="color:orange">the conditions of the planet are like that its way to extreme for humans to live there.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Venus is also has the hottest suface temperature in our solar system, even thou Mercury is closest to the sun Venus is till hotter. It has eruputing volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequesnt lightning strikes that happen on the surface of the planet</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Scientist think that long ago Venus was like Earth, but even now it still has some of the features that Earth has</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . It has the rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, craters. NASA is working to keep studying Venus. They have done fom silicon carbide tests that are simulations of the chaos of Venus's surface. <span style="color:orange">One of the things is that they are still striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So if there is a way that they are able to go there and get more samples from Venus, then maybe that might tell the scientist what might have been there before and help them out with the previous clues as what happened. They also didn't think about how fast the computers we have today would be. But they also said that just imagine exposing a cell phone, tablet to acid, or heat compatible of a metling tin, that must be what the heat is like on Venus. And since they can't be on Venus just orbiting or hovering safely they can't get the samples that they want from that distance.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>
