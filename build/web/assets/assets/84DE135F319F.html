<span style="color:white">Hey,how are you today.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span>  Well I am here today to tell you why <span style="color:orange">it would be a great idea for you to participate in the Seagoing program.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br>The reason i think it would be a great idea for you to participate in the Seagong program is because I just got done reading a artical called,'' A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves,''.And in this story the author gave me many reasons on why it would be a great idea to participate in the program.</br></br>The first reason on why it would be great is <span style="color:orange">if u enjoy caring fo animals then the Seagoing Cowboys program is the place for you</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . The reason i say this is because <span style="color:white">the UNRRA hired''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Another reason on why it would be a great idea is <span style="color:orange">the experience to visit many unique places</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> ,for example <span style="color:orange">if u like to travel and visit places you can have the side benefit of seeing Europe and China or even better you can see the special sight of the Acropolis in Greece. Also you can take a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,which is a city with streets of water. Another great thing about it is that you can tour a excavated castle in Crete and marvel at the Panama Canal on your way to China</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">But if your lazy and non disaplined i dont think this is a good trip for you because you have to be prepared for hard work .</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> </br></br>One other reason on why it would be a great idea is because <span style="color:orange">if you like to have fun and enjoy yourself than this would be great for you</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">you can find time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals have been unloaded. The cowboys play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>
