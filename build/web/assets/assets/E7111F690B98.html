<span style="color:orange">I agree with the principal and most people just hang around and dont do any work</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Kids need to start being more happy and play sports and enjoy life</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">At certain schools around the world Students act bad and just act up in general at school, and teachers dont seem to do things about it. If kids played sports more the school would gain a good reputaion. Sports are always fun, more people need to get there gets in sports like how the schools wants them too</br></br>I believe that we should have all schools make kids certain sports, in certain times of the day. Like In elementary school you have gym after a class. We should tell parents that would want there kids to do activities that they would enjoy. If we had Students playing sports everyday then lots of people would be happy, plus who doesn't like to have fun once in awhile</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If you wanna get on to the yearbook you need to be good in class and have good grades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">If you do good things like help the teacher out they might take a picture and post you on there, saying something like "This person helped me do something difficult".</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In order to be a student councilor, you need to understand others in a way that you can help them if they need it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also you need to be a decent person and very understanding. Some kids may come if they need someone to talk to or are having trouble at home. As a student councilor you have very many responsabities such as caring and helping others when they need you.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In our future we should all be happy and enjoy life. Schools should let students play sports and be a councilor or be in the year book. Parents should let there kids be a little more free.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
