Dear principle,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I disagree with your idea to require students to participate in community services. In my opinion we should have a choice in those sorts of things. Not only that but, what about homework, family, and other school or home related activities?</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.00970575502,0.286600688,<span style="color:white">0.703693534</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">There are some up sides to that idea and i understand that it would help the environment and make the neighborhood look a lot better.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.0484670579999999,0.5770961939999999,<span style="color:white">0.374436735</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But, what about what the children want?</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.1143924763999999,<span style="color:white">0.681573466</span>,0.204034055]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I'm positive that there are some students that may want to do that and that is great.

Another idea is to make that an extra activity like sports or band.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0679990176,<span style="color:white">0.5902548000000001</span>,0.3417461704]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">When would the students have time for the community service? Would it be during or after school? In my point of view either way would be interfering with either grades or home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.01729268546,0.35597435,<span style="color:white">0.6267329779999999</span>]</span> </br></br>I'm sure that a majority of the student body will agree with me on these matters. I'm just saying <span style="color:orange">it would be best to allow the students themselves choose what they want to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0262218389199999,<span style="color:white">0.483533008</span>,0.4902451520000001]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Then there will have to be parents involved too.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.106339667,<span style="color:white">0.522329604</span>,0.3713307410000001]</span>  <span style="color:orange">You would need their permission for their kids to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.213808832,<span style="color:white">0.654198456</span>,0.1319927193999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">How about you hold a vote? Then you can see some willing participants. You could also send home a question form for the parents to find out their point of view. Either way you may end up with a few people that will agree with you.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.10294774552,<span style="color:white">0.365295422</span>,0.531756813]</span>  Well that's all my opinion on this matter. If I gave you some ideas then perfect. But if not then i guess i gave it my best shot. Well, <span style="color:white">whatever you do is up to you</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.339875208</span>,0.616766474,0.0433583144]</span> . I hope you will consider a few things I mentioned. But as I said, it may collide with home and at school as well. I've said all my feelings about it.
