Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe students shouldn't have to do community service if they don't want to.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0170448828,<span style="color:white">0.418910126</span>,0.56404499]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">It shouldn't be a priority for students to help. It should be a decided thing whether the student wants to or not. Kids all want to have fun and most students don't want to spend their time doing community service. So why make them? Let kids have fun, let kids decide whether or not they want to do community service. Its the right thing to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.030640543,0.358148278,<span style="color:white">0.61121119</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Making it a priority for students to do community service can mess up students education.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.01690979992,0.380427202,<span style="color:white">0.602663004</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">If the principle made students have a class for community service could you imagine the lack of education the kids can be getting. What about the lack of physical education? What if doing community service took up physical education classes?, How do you think your students would feel? Them not being able to run around and hang out will make them furious if id didn't have physical education I'd be angry too!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0779796708,0.3725107259999999,<span style="color:white">0.549509594</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Yes, i know community service is something to better build your character,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.0428873243999999,0.5554455779999999,<span style="color:white">0.401667104</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but do teenagers really need community service? Sooner or later teenagers will figure out how to become better people. Its all part of growing up. Let your students grow up.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.0947492288,<span style="color:white">0.59067806</span>,0.31457271]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">So do you rather, making it a priority for your students to do community service or not? Do you rather them miss out on part of their education just to clean a field or to read to little children? Isn't that why we have teachers? Or do you want your students to be mad at their principle because there's not time to hang out or get all their energy out? Take it from me a student myself, you should let students have time to hang out its the best thing for kids our age. Making kids do community service may take that time up. Don't make it a priority for community service! Community service is not that big a deal!</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.01253662626,0.1863886368,<span style="color:white">0.8010747760000001</span>]</span> </br></br>Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME.
