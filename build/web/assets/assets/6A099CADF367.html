Now you msy aks yourself why?. Here are my reasons on why to exterminate the electoral college. And my ideas on what is going to replace it.</br></br><span style="color:orange">What the electoral college does is basically a chain of votes. Meaning someone votes for someone and then that someone votes for another someone.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.275738986,<span style="color:white">0.708271768</span>,0.015989228]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This may seem confusing, and personally i think it is!</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.150419278,<span style="color:white">0.8143208260000001</span>,0.0352598858]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Why vote for a slate of electors when we could vote for the president.

And then hope that they didnt steal your vote, and they voted for another candidate. You see what im saying her. The system of popular election vote is way safer than the electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1710613912,<span style="color:white">0.77251904</span>,0.0564195632]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also this system is more equal than the other, speaking of the problem of small states.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.095700856,<span style="color:white">0.828917892</span>,0.0753812328]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Ex "large states gets more attention form presidential candidates than a small state does"(4 big states, P 21 L 10).
