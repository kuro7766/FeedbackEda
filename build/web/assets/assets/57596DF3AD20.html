In paragraph 6, it states that "the software can recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused." This can allow teachers to analyze the situation in which the classroom is in. If the students are generally happy, then you can go along teaching and educating them the same way as you did before. Now, what if the students were not so enthused about your lectures? If the students show a monotone facial expression, or maybe a bored and sad one, then it might be due time to go and fix your mistakes, make the plan more exciting, and get them excited about learning. This can improve their confidence and allow them to have a bright future.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0012744948799999,0.068389952,<span style="color:white">0.930335582</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The way students act in class often create a chain reaction, making the teachers either pleased or digruntled with the way the students behave.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0475780132,<span style="color:white">0.547925008</span>,0.4044969679999999]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">If the teachers can read their expressions, change their lesson plan, and create a greatly improved learning environment, then everyone can go home happy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00213789284,0.161892792,<span style="color:white">0.835969304</span>]</span>  The students will listen more intently and the teachers will not have such a hard time dealing with <span style="color:yellow">their attitude</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0082475942,0.345957768,<span style="color:white">0.64579464</span>]</span> s.

If students could be educated the way they would want to be educated, yet still get the knowledge they need to succeed, then the future generation could be unstoppable. In paragraph 9 it states that "making faces can reveal so much about the science of emotions." There are no limits to what the next generation can do if it all starts with teachers being able to read the emotions of their students. The future starts here with this idea, and this software.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.00166109752,0.1143780339999999,<span style="color:white">0.8839608760000001</span>]</span>
