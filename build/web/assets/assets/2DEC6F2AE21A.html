<span style="color:orange">Many people don't like the way the president is picked. They are picked by the</br></br>Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  . <span style="color:orange">I on the other hand, am fine with it. What people fail to see is that because of the electoral college , is that everything is going great,</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">it's a fair judgement,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">everything is balanced</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . That's just how it is. There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.</br></br><span style="color:white">In this moment of time people just don't seem to realize that things are fine the way they are. I mean everyone's doing their own thing and living life. Some more than others, but that's the way it has always been. There are some changes here and there but they're minor ones. People just overreact , and make it seem like a big deal when it isn't. That's just the reality of it. It's not going to change</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">What a lot of people fail to realize is that it's a fair judgement.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">No crap about who they like better. They base it off what they think the person will do for the country. What good changes they would make in the future. The great things they could accomplish to help us as citizens of the United States. Now that's very good judgement.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Another thing they fail to realize is that the way they pick things, <span style="color:orange">everything is balanced</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . The elections and that stuff, is all balanced. <span style="color:orange">Everything they decide is based on the majority of who you guys picked also. It's not just based on their decision, it's also based on yours. They are actually part of you guys. So they do it to help you all not themselves.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>That's my arguement on this topic. People just fail to see that because of the electoral college, everything is going great, the judgement is fair, and <span style="color:orange">everything is balanced</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . That's what people need to realize. They need to see that what I'm saying is very true. They're just stubborn, so they just believe what they want I guess.
