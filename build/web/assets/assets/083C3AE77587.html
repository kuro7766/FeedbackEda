<span style="color:orange">With the election coming up in 2016 the debate for how the election should be run is now in dispute. So what does that mean? That means that some people disagree with the way our election is run and some dont.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In my opinion the electoral voting system is unfair and outdated.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Now there are going to be a lot of people that disgree with me, but let me tell you my reasons. <span style="color:orange">My first reason is the electoral college is not fair to the small states.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Because small states only get a small number of electoral votes canidates do not visit the small states that often. So how is that fair?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">My second reason is why not just let the poplar vote choose who is the president? After all the poplar vote is the only honest way of doing things</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The canidate that has the most votes in a poplar vote should win every time. That way is fair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">My third and final reason is with the electoral voting system there is actually a chance of tying.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">if they tye what do you do now? Should we flip a coin to see who wins possibly one of the most important descisons</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> ?</br></br>the end</br></br>Â©PROPER_NAME ;) ;) ;) ;) ;)
