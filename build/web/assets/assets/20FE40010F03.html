To the principle of this school</br></br><span style="color:orange">I read your policy's on the internet so i am going to respond in my best opinion</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">I think if you don't let students have phones in school, then their be no point of having rules. yes i know that students text during classes but their are kids what can you do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But if you let them have phones and use them during free time. Then the kids will call and text each other on the whole school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Then that will be bad, and they will still don't have any education and will not pass their classes</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . So <span style="color:orange">my guess is to not have cell phones at all or their will fail at school and in life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br>but <span style="color:orange">if you let them have phones the you will be the most popular and cool principle of all time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  But <span style="color:orange">if you don't then they will hate you for ever and do bad stuff to you</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> . So <span style="color:orange">what do you chouse popularity or the education for the kids. But my decision is no cell phones</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Best of lucked just a person</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
