It can go higher in the air meaning it can avoid the storm, earthquakes, and erupting volcanoes. NASA has not found a way to use the vehicle to help reasearchers get samples from Venus. Scine they are in the air above the gas clouds it would be hard for researchers to get photography or videography of Venus surface.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.251454538,<span style="color:white">0.7371229300000001</span>,0.01142256536]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They have been fooling around with silicon carbide electronics.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.227925252,<span style="color:white">0.764968576</span>,0.00710616664]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">NASA and its scientists has been useing silicon carbide electronic in a testing chamber that is set like Venus.
