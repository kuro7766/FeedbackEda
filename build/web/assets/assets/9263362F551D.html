It can go higher in the air meaning it can avoid the storm, earthquakes, and erupting volcanoes. NASA has not found a way to use the vehicle to help reasearchers get samples from Venus. Scine they are in the air above the gas clouds it would be hard for researchers to get photography or videography of Venus surface.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They have been fooling around with silicon carbide electronics.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">NASA and its scientists has been useing silicon carbide electronic in a testing chamber that is set like Venus. This new technology could be used on Venus when NASA figurs out a way to increase the survability time of silicon carbide electronic. They have not figuer it out yet and could be decades before they figer it out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They also have one more item they have been test that is mechanical computers.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">We used mechanical computer in 1940s dring World War II. Scientest think that we can make the parts immune to Venus's harsh conditions. They could be made to resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. This is one of the of projects that will hopefuly beat Venus's challenges.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There are three ways NASA has been try to beat Venus challenges. We have yet to try them on Venus. If one of this ways works we have the satitfation of completing the challenge Venus gave us.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
