Dear Senator,</br></br>I, like the job you are doing and you're doing it quite well. But <span style="color:yellow">what is this electoral college? You are telling me that i vote for electors thta supposedly are pulling fior my choice of candidate for pesident. I don't think that is right to just take my choice of president and put it in someone else's hands. It should be my choice to whom I want it to be. Now I realize that there is probably some rule that prevents them to changing their mind, but actually I don't think that there is such a rule.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.125257082,0.735323194,<span style="color:white">0.1394197288</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think that we should be rid this Electoral College and go by popular vote. So this way my vote is directly counted and going towards the candidate of my choice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.057129531,<span style="color:white">0.86288457</span>,0.0799859154]</span>  <span style="color:white">Now I know that ths would be a big thing because it is unconstitutional, so we should have a vote upon what the people think. Whether we should keep up with this electoral college buisness.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.7070955860000001</span>,0.289982842,0.0029215828799999]</span>  <span style="color:white">Another thing, why wasn't I, a american, told about all of this. Because my vote probably doesn't even matter now that i think about it, it's probably just a trashed paper that goes toward these electors. How doesd these electors just get chosen, do you wof your way up or you get it if your popular?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.7246907659999999</span>,0.271486226,0.0038230159199999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">What would happen if these electors just went with a different candidate and left all the voters in the dust?</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.13098712,<span style="color:white">0.8462116980000001</span>,0.0228011608]</span>  <span style="color:white">If so that this happened what would happen to the election?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.525094848</span>,0.471448804,0.00345634464]</span>  I have questions and i need answers.</br></br>GoodbyeÂ
