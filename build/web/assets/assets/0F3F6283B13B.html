Face The Landform?</br></br><span style="color:orange">Everyone seems to believe that the face on mars was created by Aliens. They say that the scientists are wrong by saying it was a natural landform. But, do they actually do research like the scientists do?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0873647642,<span style="color:white">0.891781286</span>,0.0208539546]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There are many reasons that the face on mars is just a lanform,</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0768449474,<span style="color:white">0.907551478</span>,0.0156035873]</span>  and here are those reasons.</br></br><span style="color:orange">First off, when NASA's Vicking one spacecraft was just circling and roaming around it came across something unexpecting.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.115742286,<span style="color:white">0.865831826</span>,0.0184258768]</span>  <span style="color:orange">By snapping a few pictures, they believed it was a face. Later, when it was revealed to the world, people believed that aliens had made that mark on mars. The texts says, that no one has past over that "face" in awhile. So how come a few pictures identify a face by using one camera? So that's when scientist decided to investigate the face on mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.20651808,<span style="color:white">0.7781260019999999</span>,0.0153559359999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">After scientists did a little research on their own, "The Face" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0514668261999999,0.903983092,<span style="color:white">0.0445500826</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">How can that be? Well, i will expect no one to believe that because for 25 years it was known as the face on mars. Scientists had to travel up to space by Mars and snap several pictures of the face. After they did their research collected thir data it came out to be a landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.171594278,<span style="color:white">0.814701932</span>,0.0137037714]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Some say that the scientists used a digital three image camera.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1695143888</span>,0.82003208,0.0104535457399999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">What's the difference its just a camera</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.24447792,<span style="color:white">0.749395252</span>,0.0061268498399999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Well, that camera captured the truth about mars.

So, it was just a false staement. There was no alien monument, in the first place. So for 25 years the face on Mars was actually a messa. But NASA would rather hide the truth about what they saw. So until, it's revealed as an actual face, it will be known as a messa or some peopel still say it's the face of Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1771234,<span style="color:white">0.79896719</span>,0.0239093952]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So with that all said, the face turned out to be a messa. So with the actual data, everyone should know that it is a messa. So wa sthe face really created by aliens, no it was not. It was really a landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0548651352,<span style="color:white">0.912648846</span>,0.032486003]</span>
