To whom it may concerned:</br></br><span style="color:orange">For me, Policy 1 is better, base from my own opinion. Because Policy 1 would be better from Policy 2</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">For students to avoid breaking the rules of their own school, Policy 1 would be the better choice</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Because they can use their phones during their break, lunch periods and whenever they have a free time. In some cases, most students and parents prefer to have the Policy 1 so that whenever they have an emergency or an important thing to do so, they can easily contact each other, except for contacting each other inside their classes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">As long as their phones are in silence or they won't be using it during their class time, Policy 1 is a good choice</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">And for me, Policy 1 is the best choice among all of the choices that the principle would have. For students, having Policy 1 could be nice. I think they would really appreciate it if they would be having that policy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Because if in some reason, Policy 2 would be the one that the Principle will be choosing, there's a possibility that a lot of students will make a way to break the rule just to bring their gadgets, even though they might get into trouble</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">But, students must know their limitations whenever they use their phones or gadgets inside the campus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Students shouldn't be using it whenever the teacher is discussing or whenever they're inside their classrooms.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Because, instead of learning a lot of things from the school, they would just waste their time using those gadgets</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I hope that you understand me why I chose Policy 1 rather than the other Policy which is the second choice. Because I know how it feels like when you don't have your phone by your side and didn't noticed that something emergency from your family is happening. I wish you would be considering or approving my opinion. I choosing the right opinion so that won't have any alibis for breaking the rule of your school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely yours,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
