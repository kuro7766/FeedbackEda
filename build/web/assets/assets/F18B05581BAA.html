Going to school may seem boring and useless but it gives you experience, especially with adult figures. Online classes dont offer sports so if you wanted to join a sport you cant through a computer, unless you are playing online. Once you get out of school you will miss it. It is a great time to explore who you are and who you want to be.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0937151438,<span style="color:white">0.850208112</span>,0.0560767611]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Finally if you dont go to school you will not make new friends</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0488206156,<span style="color:white">0.894542832</span>,0.0566365872]</span> . <span style="color:orange">It is hard to make new friends and meet new people through a computer. It is so much fun making friends in a school full of one thousand people. It is great to be in school and have friends in your classes. School is like a pool full of new and mysterious people. It is good to have teachers by your side for help. Friends are a really good support system. If you are home and something happens it is good to go to school and talk to your friends about it instead of staying home and keeping it in. Friends help with a lot that you need.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0645256758,<span style="color:white">0.845665518</span>,0.0898088294]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I get that home school is fun but it isnt always the best choice.
