<span style="color:orange">I think you should use policy 1. allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I thing you should go with this policy because there is no need to take cell phones away.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Because almost all people have cell phones and that will mean they cant use it. And I think they should at least be able to use them on there free time as long as they are no bothering anyone and they keep it on vibrate .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">But I also belive that no one should use them during class because it will be a bother to every one and they wont be able to get there work done because someone would be sitting in class just texting on there phone.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But if some don't bring phones to school at all then they wont be able to call there parents to pick them up or in case of a emergency. but the students should not be walking around the school talking on there phones just walking into people because there no paying any attention to what they are doing at all. and they should have there phones off during class to like I already said so no one is on there on there phone in the middle of class bothering people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Using policy two is just going way to far</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">because the only way that I would do that one is if all of the kids in the school get on there phones in the middle of class and just stay on it for the whole time without doing anything else without even paying attention to anyone or anything else. But policy one is more understanding because it is getting phones out of the way while they are working but not while they are on there free time because phones shouldn't bother anyone if its on there free spare time</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  . <span style="color:white">But that is my reasen why i would go with policy one.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
