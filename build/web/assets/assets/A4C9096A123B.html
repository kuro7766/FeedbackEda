Dear, State Sentor</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think the electoral college should be changed and people old enough to vote should be able to chhose who they want to be president</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">I think people should be able to choose who they want to be prsident because. And he start destroying the economy and he starts taking away things that some people need to survive or maintain.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">One reason I think citizens should be able to choose who they want to be prsident because what if someone gets elected as president and for example he or she decides to begin a marshal law in the whole united states.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Then he starts putting a chip in evevyones body and we get told when to eat and when not to eat. Then he or she starts to put us in concentration camps and we get paid 2 cents a hour and killed if we dont cooperate.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Another reason I think citizens should be able to choose who they want to be president is because. Its not fair to people cause that would be like a citizens vote doesnt even count and the government doesnt really care about what citizens think and they dont care about how we feel.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Then if the wrong person gets elected and he or does something no one likes everybody gone be mad cause they didnt for that to happen.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Finally I think citizens should be able to vote for who they want to be president is because I honestly dont think the government doent care how anybody feel.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">And The Electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. The electoral college method for selecting presidents may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no carrying their state.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Now you see why I think people should be able to choose who they want to be president. I hope you enjoy reading my letter and i hope you see where im coming from and what im talking about.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
