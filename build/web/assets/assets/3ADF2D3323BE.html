When you start having free time or lunch period, then its alright for you to use your phone because nobody is teaching you. My opinion is that its better off if we can use our phones while having lunch or break time, so nobody can tell you to put your phone away or take it away from you because its our time to do whatever we want to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1720220587999999</span>,0.807833692,0.02014426828]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Using phones in class is really disrespectful and you'll never learn anything in class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0727449736,<span style="color:white">0.904816196</span>,0.02243882252]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If you are in a middle of a class, your teacher is teaching and suddenly you have a phone call or text. you shouldn't pick it up. Ignore the phone and stay with what the teacher is teaching you about. Also, you shouldn't leave your phone on in class because then its easier to concentrate what teacher is telling you. If your phone is on then your phone will vibrate, ring, and bother you. Then the phone's noises will urge you to pick it up.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0958041188,<span style="color:white">0.853824442</span>,0.050371436]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The bell ring's and its time for lunch or break time.
