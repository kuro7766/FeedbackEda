<span style="color:orange">In this essay i will be explaining the difference and similarities and the pros and cons of the electoral college and opposing it</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I personally like the idea of having the people themselves vote</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because the electors could change their mind</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">because it makes more sense to just vote for who you think should be president</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . As of right now i dont really care if it changes or not because i dont vote for another 4 years.</br></br>First, "Whats wrong with electoral college". <span style="color:orange">one reason to pick electors is because its less people to keep count of. Having these electors is another step in the voting procces but it keeps things going easier.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In conlusion, i dont agree with this, there is almost nothing i can think of that is good about this, unfortunutely.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Secondly, The great points of having the people themselves vote (which i agree with)</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">One reason, is that electors can change their mind and vote for whoever they want and it could completely change the election. Secondly, This requires the president to go to all states exculding no one! This way all states feel equal and they feel like all of their votes matter. Another great reason is that they focus more on toss up states where people tend to pay more attention. Another good reason, is that bigger states get more attention. This is important because he can reach out to more people rather than a smaller state.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, I think having people do the elections themselves is the better option</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> . I hope you can come to agree with me.
