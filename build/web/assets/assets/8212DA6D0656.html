<span style="color:orange">Did you know on Mars there is a face? Some people think it was created by aliens. Other people think it is just a natural landform on Mars. The face on Mars was first discovered in 1976.</br></br>When they first saw it it looked like a "shadowy likeness of a human face". It was an enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end. When they first discovered it they saw it staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0387009536,<span style="color:white">0.7885860900000001</span>,0.172712939]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I am going to be telling you why this is just a natural landform on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0733784534,<span style="color:white">0.88460962</span>,0.0420119124]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">When scientist first saw it in 1976, they thought it was just another Martian mesa which is common around Cydonia</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0413683744,<span style="color:white">0.8719127780000001</span>,0.086718829]</span> . <span style="color:orange">They knew is was some type of landform. A few days later, NASA unvieled the image for all to see. The caption was "huge rock formation which resembles a human head". The only reason they said it was aliens, was to get people's attention. That is exaclty what it did.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1332117827999999,<span style="color:white">0.825917452</span>,0.0408707552]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Eventually on April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over to Cydonia for the first time to check it out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0633613066,<span style="color:white">0.859070648</span>,0.077568047]</span>  <span style="color:orange">While they were there Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the original photos.

"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view,"Garvin stated. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size", Garvin added. "So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" he added.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0909576132,<span style="color:white">0.753127416</span>,0.155914966]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They could tell there was nothing just the land its self.

"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho", Garvin says.
