Duffer shows us how "the smog" that invades the city became a rival to Beijing, China, which is known as the most polluted cities in the world. Imagine going outside to see the beautiful sun, and instead open the door to cars delivering blinding "smog." We can't allow ourselves to become the most polluted cities, and the first step is to manage ourselves with our cars.</br></br><span style="color:yellow">There's some of us who suffer from stress and anxiety. There's some of us who look at our community and are probably never wanting to go outside again. That is not a community to live in. We deserve to feel relieved, relaxed, and renewed from time to time. In 'Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota' by Andrew Selsky, it demonstrates a perfect example. Selsky writes about a "Car-Free" day in Bogota, Columbia, and a man shares his side of this event. Carlos Arturo Plaza tells us, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polluton." Selsky writes in paragraph 28 the benefits of this event. He writes, "Parks and sport centers bloomed... Dramatically cut traffic... New restaurants and shopping districts developed." Look what we can accomplish from not using our cars as much.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00488008952,0.108657226,<span style="color:white">0.8864626620000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">We're in a time where money is the top priority in our lives. All those gas prices, and the car insurance car owners must pay is ridiculous. Sometimes people can't even sleep at night due to all the thinking of "how will I pay this?", or "how will I pay that?" It later becomes a constant battle. This is when technology comes in handy. Now with the common "Facebook" and other social media, we're able to connect more and more. It's sad to see people waste their money going to a friends house for probably an hour or so, when they can just talk virtually. Elisabeth Rosenthal, writer of 'The End of Car Culture,' most likely will agree with me. Rosenthal inputs Mimi Sheller's say in all this. Sheller is a sociology professor at Drexel University, and she cites important factors on paragraph 35.
