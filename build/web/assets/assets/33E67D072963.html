It means that actually care about the ones around you. <span style="color:orange">So i believe that our school should get up and make a change for once. There should be no more sitting around, doing things we already know, when we could out there, in the world, helping others, learning new things, and how all of this is useful to us. We could show our town, our community, and everyone else in the world, that we were given an amazing thing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.2195328399999999,<span style="color:white">0.68862394</span>,0.0918432092]</span>
