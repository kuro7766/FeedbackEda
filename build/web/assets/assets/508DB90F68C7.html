This technology can tell what their emotional state is when in the classroom. If they are bored they might not like the way their teacher is teaching them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So the teacher can modify the way she teaches that specific lesson, so that the student has a better attitude toward that subject.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This technology can also help councelers talk to the students that might be having personal problems like bullies, or family issues at home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Kids wouldn't be able to hide their emotions as well with this techlology being in every classrom. For example with a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major, and another muscle called the risorius. You cant download the software on a normal computer, so schools would have to pay for the device its-self. It would be extremely expensive but it would help many students in classrooms, or some that need counceling.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Humans perform this type of calculation every day, for instance when you ask a friend if they are ok, because they look depressed or angry. We can perform this calculation as accurately as the current technology we have now.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">For example Leonardo da Vinci used this type of calculation and knew exactly how her face needed to look in order to get the emotions he was looking for.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion this technology has many benefits for students and children that need counceling for personal problems, and or family problems at home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
