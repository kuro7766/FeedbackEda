Being athletic sets a good look on you especially if your good at the sport , its also a good way to make friends . It also helps to get focus off of so many things . Doing sports makes you only have to focus on keeping your grade to stay in that sport . It may also be good for stress it could possibly relieve it and it makes you feel great .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>2. <span style="color:orange">Working on a yearbook may not be that interesting or entertaining to most students but it still a good way to set a good look on yourself</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  . <span style="color:orange">Not everyone thinks yearbook is fun but everyone has their own opinions it's a great distraction .
