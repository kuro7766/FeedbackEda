Some people may have counter calims first counter claim is why would NASA lie to us. Second counter claim is that the picture showed a face so it is a face. Third counter claim is that they had a good camera so if it shows it then it is a face. My rebuttals would be that NASA is not lieing about the pictures. Second the picture might create an illusion that makes you think it's a face. Third not all cameras show exactly what you want to take a picture of these are my counter claims and rebuttals and also my example and explanantions</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1295567014,<span style="color:white">0.8375420520000001</span>,0.0329012406]</span> .
