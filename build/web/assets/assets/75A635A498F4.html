Dear Principal</br></br><span style="color:orange">I Think its a great idea for us to start doing community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Community service is an important thing because there's a lot of people that don't care about our world, and they would throw garbage on the street,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but we can make things better by cleaning an picking up all litters.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This would also be good for some kids that only spend time on video games.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">they could actually help and doing something for others, instead of doing what they like to do.</br></br>As the months past by we see that Our country is not the same, for these problems</br></br>For example, Littering, Robbing, Pollution, etc.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">This could also be a punishment for kids.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">So if there were to have bad grades, You could tell them either you do better or do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The only thing that probably wouldn't be a good thing is if you made them do community service on weekends</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:white">That would just be unfair from my point of view, and im pretty sure parents would agree with me.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also There are also some community service that im sure people would apply to like Helping the elderly or spending time with them at nursery, And maybe taking care of pets without Owners.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  What else could I say, Like i said I think this is a good idea</br></br>I give you my 100%. On doing this and making our country better and the students helping out by doing community service.</br></br><span style="color:orange">My second Example On how Community service is good is by us older grades help out little elementary school kids.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">How does that help? It helps because if there stuck on a question or need help with there homework. The older grades can tutor them or explain to them</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Well I hope You consider on taking this letter a help</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>  and Good luck to your decision</br></br>Sincerely STUDENT_NAME
