Dear Mr Senator, <span style="color:orange">whats the point in voting if our vote may not even count?</br></br>In the Electoral college people citizens vote for a slate of electors who then later go and vote for president. However, sometimes it doesnt work that way. The electors are not obligated to choose the president that the people want.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0126314022599999,<span style="color:white">0.31537376</span>,0.671994802]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The Electoral college is corrupt and needs to go away.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0236460426,0.501771808,<span style="color:white">0.4745821579999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The people of America dont like the Electoral college and want something new.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0310251956,0.54666071,<span style="color:white">0.422314098</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Stated in source 2, " Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanksto the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent off voters would prefer a dirt election to the kind we have now."

In 1960, segregationists in the lousiana legislature tried to get rid of the democratic electors. They wanted to replace them with people who would oppose John F Kennedy. Sourse 2, number 11 says "In some vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please..." This means that with an Electoral college, the person you want to vote for may not even get picked cause of lying electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01397276992,0.2298935787999999,<span style="color:white">0.7561336540000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Even though the electoral college is a pretty bad thing, there are still a few upsides.
