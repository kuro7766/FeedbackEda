Likewise, students all have different sets of skills and things that they enjoy. Some students may want to do something that is not offered at that school, yet they wouldn't be able to. It doesn't make sense that they should participate in something that they don't enjoy. If a person who does not like to play sports is forced to play an after school sport, that would unfair towards them. Or, if a person who only likes to draw has to take an extracurricular activity, what would they do if there isn't an art club? Making the students do something they would not like or they're not interested in is not very fair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00501697306,0.103418154,<span style="color:white">0.891564886</span>]</span> </br></br>People are free to choose to do what they want, and everyone has that freedom. <span style="color:yellow">Making participation mandatory for extracurricular activities is impeding on the students right to choose for themselves.

It is important students that students have the right to choose so they know that there are always options. If students are forced to take extracurricular activites, they will become more disheartened, more weary and tired from balancing their social and academic lives along with sports and other classes, and wake up with less promise that they would have a good day. After all, we do need to nurture our students, as they are the future of the world, as the next generation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.00156300741,0.080009724,<span style="color:white">0.918427278</span>]</span>
