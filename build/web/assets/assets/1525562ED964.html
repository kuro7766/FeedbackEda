Dear Senator , <span style="color:orange">I have read a lot about electoral college voting.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It seems like a legit way of finding the right president to be in charge of our country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">But it also says that it's a compromise between the votes in Congress , and the votes of the popularity from the people. Is it a 50/50 compromise or does Congress have a stronger voting advantage over the people</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> ?</br></br><span style="color:white">I think that if your going to make Congress's choices , able to rule over the peoples , then there shouldn't be two sides of the voting.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Its not fair to us. It should be an equal advantage. There should be a way for that to happen if there already isn't one. Congress and society need to have an equal chance at electing the best man for the job.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">A non-democratic method of selecting a president ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes , the winner. The cause of this is probably because Congress think theyare more wise and think this throught more then the people do. But I think differently. The citizens of the US , can be just as smart as Congress. Maybe even smarter or wiser.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I honestly think that you should leave a majority of it to the people because we can the research before we vote so we know which one would make the best choices for our country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>  If you gave us a chance to show you what we can do and that we can be smart about things , then maybe you would recommend the people being in charge of more things.
