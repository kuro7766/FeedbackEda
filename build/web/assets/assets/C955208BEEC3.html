Dear Editor</br></br><span style="color:orange">To have kids take community service is good for the world and it should be required to do community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0561771228,<span style="color:white">0.8873636420000001</span>,0.0564592504]</span>  and <span style="color:white">to clean up the school would help then people would do it but if it involves cleaning then some people will say yes and some no.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1219096839999999</span>,0.8402307199999999,0.0378596112]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">but people like me would be happy to help and keep this city clean. And my friends wanted to join them in community service and i got in with them and now that the principal wants us to clean the school and to clean the litter was easy but the rest of the school was still unfinished. So then when we were almost done we cleaned the halls, class rooms, and helped the janitors mope certain areas and now our and community service is best to do</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.312078474,<span style="color:white">0.6103804339999999</span>,0.077541095]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">it also takes time away from your education.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1227369319999999,<span style="color:white">0.853534472</span>,0.0237286076]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So the best thing to do is to have community service on some days and get people who want to do it so the choice is yes the principal should but get people that enjoy community service. And for example like if i were to be doing the service and i enjoyed it then id want to keep on doing it but is i didn't enjoy it then i would be home doing homework. But also have it after school and get people who can stay to perform the service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.379267454,<span style="color:white">0.56668741</span>,0.0540451636]</span>
