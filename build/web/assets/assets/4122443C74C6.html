I have seen many landmarks, such as the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, and I also have been through the Panama Canal on my way to China. Also it is a fun experience after the animals had to be unloaded, we all played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed. Also there would be table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and many more fun activities. Those were all some ways we had a fun experience during the program.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.055483012,0.580812806,<span style="color:white">0.363704176</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Our program also takes care of animals, but that can also be fun in many ways.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0252569776,0.490957852,<span style="color:white">0.483785162</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">One way is that it can keep you busy is when you are caring for the animals during crossing. They have to be fed and watered three times a day. What helped me prepare for hard work was when I would help on my Aunt Katie's farm as a boy. Also I would serve as a night watchmen, which meant I had to check on the animals every night. Once I almost died doing that job one rainy night. As you can see, taking care of animals can be hard but also fun here at Seagoing Cowboys program.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1241579504,<span style="color:white">0.6454419579999999</span>,0.230400048]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">My favorite part was traveling to many countries and all the beautiful sights.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0181571295,0.45771761,<span style="color:white">0.5241252559999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I have gotten to see Europe and China during our journies. Cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. I have also toured an excavated castle in Crete, and have been on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, the city with streets of water. As you can see in the first paragraph, where it also shows I have been to many other places. In conlusion, you can see that traveling a one of the most fun parts of beingin the Seagoing Cowboys program.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1195169488,<span style="color:white">0.620935814</span>,0.2595472131999999]</span> </br></br>Throughout the whole story, you can see that in the Seagoing Cowboys program, <span style="color:yellow">it is a fun experience,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0333723821999999,0.5919566439999999,<span style="color:white">0.3746709499999999</span>]</span>  it helps animals, and you get to travel a whole lot. Those are some of the reasons that I would like others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.
