Then the teacher says I used the emotional expression technology. The student would just feel awkward, because the teacher just figured out their emotions when they probably wanted to keep it to themselves. This is why the use of technology to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0308597258,<span style="color:white">0.8398637860000001</span>,0.129276504]</span>
