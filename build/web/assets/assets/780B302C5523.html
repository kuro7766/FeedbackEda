<span style="color:orange">Do you think driverless cars are a good idea? Yes or No? Driverless cars can have positive effects and negative effects. The cars could change the world or they could not end well.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Driverless cars are not a good idea at all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The reason is, because the cars really are not fully driverless.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">if you are in a constrution zone or near an accident the car has you take over. The car isn't full capable of handling driving in a situation like that. The car lets the driver know when they should take over. So the question is " If the car is driverless how come you have to take over in certain situations"? Why can't the car handle it all on its own since the car is smart? For the driverless cars to be very smart they need a bunch of sensors.</br></br>My postion on driverless cars is I think they are a bad idea. They can't fully handle all situations. Also if the person behind the wheel is drunk or worse and they come upon a bad accident " What will they do"? " How will they act"? Since the car can't handle itself and the driver is incoherent I dont think the ending result will be very good at all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>First off, <span style="color:white">the driver of the car must stay alert at all times and be ready to take over if needed. If there is an accident or the wiring or technology fails in the car.</br></br>" Who is blamed"? "Do you blame the driver or the maufacturer"?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Even though the traffic laws would be changed, according to the driverless cars there would be new laws put in to cover liability in a situation if there was an accident.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  Also there are special sensors that make sure the driver keeps his hands on the wheel.</br></br>Do you think driverless cars are a good idea?
