The car isn't full capable of handling driving in a situation like that. The car lets the driver know when they should take over. So the question is " If the car is driverless how come you have to take over in certain situations"? Why can't the car handle it all on its own since the car is smart? For the driverless cars to be very smart they need a bunch of sensors.</br></br>My postion on driverless cars is I think they are a bad idea. They can't fully handle all situations. Also if the person behind the wheel is drunk or worse and they come upon a bad accident " What will they do"? " How will they act"? Since the car can't handle itself and the driver is incoherent I dont think the ending result will be very good at all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2234827059999999,<span style="color:white">0.7028053799999999</span>,0.0737119212]</span> </br></br>First off, <span style="color:white">the driver of the car must stay alert at all times and be ready to take over if needed.
