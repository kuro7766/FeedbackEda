Dear Senator ,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I beleive that we should keep the electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">I say that because it would be choas if we did not have them keeping the voting in check.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I have one reason why we should keep the electoral college. And that is to make and keep the right/ best person for president to we can feel safe and good about the newly elected president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I can see where you think that the electoral college doesnt really do anything.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">But thats were you would be wrong.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">I say that because without them there could be a horrible president that just made ppresident because he was good at advertising and he is paying off companys to advertise to make him look better. But i can see what your getting at because he did win fair and square but that doesnt mean that he will turn out to be a good president. That were the electoral college will come in, by chosing the true person who will be there for our country when we need him the most.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">And its not like the people are not choosing their president. The electoral college still go's with the peoples vote they just go in more depth with choosing the right president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">So in the end everyone wins. the people will have the best leader of the united states they can have thanks to the electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  So why take them away, all they do is help us.</br></br>yours truly</br></br>PROPER_NAME
