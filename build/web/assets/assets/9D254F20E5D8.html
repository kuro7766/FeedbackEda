Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that we should change over to election by popular vote</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I thinks that because in the Electoral College the voters dont vote on the president, but instead they vote on the electors who then vote for the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">"It's official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. "The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense....it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. There are five reasons for getting rid of the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are preactical, not liberal or conservative reasons.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Some people disagree though they think that we should stick with the electoral college. They think its a good way to do the voting because they get to choose the electors who will choose our president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Inconclusion, I think that we should do election by popular vote because then the voters get to choose the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerly,</br></br>Britney
