Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe that you should have the students perform community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">I think that community service is very important</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span>  but <span style="color:orange">some of the other students think it is a complete waste of time</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So I would like to add a "trash clean-up" project for the students who do nothing, or want to help out the school during recess time. It will be on or around campus during the lunch period for fifteen minutes a day. Then the next few days after the school is cleaned up, we should have "reading buddies" for students in preschool and kindergarten</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">it will give younger students a larger vocabulary, and give the older students higher social skills.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I clean up the playground during recess, read to students, and I bake cookies for the elderly people at the local retirement home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">They can do those for the community service you want the students to do at school, and give us a better outlook on life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Thank you,</br></br>A student.
