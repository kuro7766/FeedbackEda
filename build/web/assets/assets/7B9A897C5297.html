<span style="color:yellow">In today's world, technology is everywhere. Technology helps assist in everyday tasks and brings about new levels of creativity. In this new age of innovation, smart cars fit right in with all other aspects of our digitalized lives. Not only could driverless cars help in many other ways regular cars can't, but they also allow for an increase in safety potential.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.00373691424,0.14421735,<span style="color:white">0.852045768</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Overall, driverless cars will be beneficial for the modern world.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.01304083,0.4470456739999999,<span style="color:white">0.539913498</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The use of driverless cars can vary from ecofriendly transportation to customization for individual scheduals.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.008931199,0.324418774,<span style="color:white">0.666650052</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">By using driverless cars as a taxi system, gas consumption would majorly decrease. The taxi system idea could also lead to new ways of public transportation. These cars could take their passengers anywhere they needed to go through a direct route. Passengers would no longer have to wait for long periods of time on buses for their stops. These driverless systems would allow for greater flexibility overall.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0317513548,<span style="color:white">0.510403348</span>,0.4578452979999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Driverless cars would also help communities everywhere with safety.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00660186114,0.30575938,<span style="color:white">0.6876387700000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Since these smart cars are loaded with sensor technology, they can help limit the amount of crashes that were regularly happening. The protypes of driverless cars have gone millions of miles without crashes and could help stunt the commonality of vehicular crashes and deaths. Driverless cars could also aide with the safety for learning and elderly drivers. Oftentimes, teenage drivers and drivers with slow reaction times are the causes of accidents that could have been avoided with easy assistance. Smart, semi-driverless cars could be the answer to these costly problems.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00950996406,0.261766014,<span style="color:white">0.72872402</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Ultimately, driverless cars would have an extreme influence on today's society. The assistance from technology has changed the world we live in and will continue to do so. Driverless cars are the step in the right direction for driving innovations all across the world.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0317479878,0.45527188,<span style="color:white">0.512980156</span>]</span>
