Dear state senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe we should change the election process. You should change it to an election of popular vote and give the people power to decide not on the electors for the candidates, but just on the candidates themselves.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0127503849999999,<span style="color:white">0.432092466</span>,0.5551571399999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It would be a much easier process,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.08365715,<span style="color:white">0.789434728</span>,0.126908141]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">at the same time, a much less expensive way of electing presidents.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0524735094,<span style="color:white">0.69256828</span>,0.2549582039999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">There was a Gallup poll in 2000 that even states that 60% of the population of voters prefered a direct election instead of using the electoral college. That year, Al Gore won the popular vote, but, thanks to the electoral college, he lost the presidency.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.0701499596</span>,0.676175566,0.253674478]</span> </br></br>Also, <span style="color:orange">the electoral college is an unreliable way to elect the president</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0342713496,<span style="color:white">0.698575128</span>,0.267153512]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">the people can't know for sure who chose the electors.
