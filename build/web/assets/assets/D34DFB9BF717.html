<span style="color:orange">In the education system, students are always required to be learning, advocating, and being better prepared for the future. But what happens when students go on summer break? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning over the break. Some argue that the projects should be teacher designed, while others argue that it should be student designed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.062416082,<span style="color:white">0.7516467</span>,0.1859372408]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The projects should be student designed</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0941512526,<span style="color:white">0.8287004320000001</span>,0.077148351]</span>  since <span style="color:orange">students wont be as motivated if they themselves didn't design it</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.040298821,<span style="color:white">0.8266981660000001</span>,0.133003004]</span> , and <span style="color:orange">it is their break time from school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0837777911999999,<span style="color:white">0.8335498219999999</span>,0.0826723518]</span> </br></br>When students are assigned to complete summer projects during their break, they should be student designed. <span style="color:orange">They should be student designed since they will be more motivated to complete the project.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0359112644,<span style="color:white">0.798769612</span>,0.165319087]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When giving the students a teacher designed project they will ,most of the time, feel very unmotivated and bitter towards it. However, if the project is being designed by the students, it will allow for the students to learn more from the project and result with more excitement, motivation, and better work ethic. Not only will the students get more joy out of doing a project they designed, but they will also be able to apply a more creative side of themselves they might have not even known they had.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0448388956,<span style="color:white">0.74229919</span>,0.2128619076]</span> </br></br>When students are assigned to complete summer projects during their break they should be student designed. <span style="color:orange">They should be student designed since that is their break from school and during their break, they can do whatever they please to do with their time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0702569652,<span style="color:white">0.7996316120000001</span>,0.1301114313999999]</span>  <span style="color:white">That time is given as a break from school since throughout all the other months, they are required to learn what they are being taught.
