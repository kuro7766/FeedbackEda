With the Electoral College some electors could defy the will of the people and vote for the opposite of what most people voted for. Say the 35 million people in california and 15,000,001 million people vote for one person and 14,999,999 people vote for the other those 14 million peoples votes are pointless with the electoral college and its not fair that the canidate doesn't even get one of those votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.225462642,<span style="color:white">0.7349079319999999</span>,0.0396294509999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion i say just get rid of the electoral college because of all the votes that won't count and all the people that voted and not a single one of their votes goes to who they voted for. If it was by popular vote one person could get majority of the electoral votes but less of the popular votes and if there was no electoral college some of the presidents might not have been president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.17265888,<span style="color:white">0.798333692</span>,0.0290074125999999]</span>
