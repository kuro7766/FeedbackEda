<span style="color:orange">I'm here to tell you that the face on mars is not the face to a martian</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:white">but there is always both sides to a situation like this.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">I'm a scientist and there are some explanation to why this face exsict on both sides</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">My side is that the face on mars could be seen wrong, it could be a pile of rocks,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">and there is many wierd things on this planet with weird shapes, it cant always be martians or aliens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">So to start this off it could be a alien but there is a strong possibility that its not either.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">First the face is way to larg to be an actual face, it say it the artical the it is measured in meters, thats almost impossible</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">It also says in the artical that the face on mars was just an illusion caused by the shadowing on the rocks to make it look like a face. If you look furter into the artical it says that everytime they went across the planet that it looked exactly the same.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">It is a real debate on whether the face is real or not. There is also strong evidence on both sides, but NASA has alot of proof that it isn't an alien, they could be hiding it or they can be wrong.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
