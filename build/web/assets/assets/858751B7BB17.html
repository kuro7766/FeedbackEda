Then someone would have to go up there maybe put a drone or rover on it drive it around and see. Then someone would have to go back up there and get the rover then look at the video to see if anythings there. Then we would have to see if theres air on this planet so maybe one day humans can live on a differnt planet.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.83637209</span>,0.162971822,0.00065608712]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">That is why we don'go to venus yet because then we would have to built better rockets. Then we would have to get astronut food and make sure they have air helment just in case. Maybe some jet packs just in case. they get stuck and cant find a way back.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.8308807659999999</span>,0.1686725339999999,0.000446627058]</span>
