If your a fan of Obama then you should love the fact that we use electoral votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.239068754,<span style="color:white">0.728515166</span>,0.0324160795999999]</span> </br></br>Electoral votes make it so that a president can only win the election if the have the trans-regional vote. <span style="color:orange">A trans-regional vote means that if a president was popular in, lets say the south, but not in the west and only the south voted for him then he/she could not be elected. A candidate must have a widely spread out amount of votes across the regions in order to be elected president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1201345448,<span style="color:white">0.79433296</span>,0.0855325126]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">There are such things as swing states. Swing states mean that the state is made up of people who are democratic and republican so the state has a mixed variety of voters. Candidates spend a lot of time campagning in these swing states to try and persuade the voters in the state into their favor.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.440350678</span>,0.53552325,0.024126059]</span>  Swing states could be seen as tie breakers.</br></br>You may not think so, but <span style="color:orange">in electoral voting the size and population of a state matters.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1652381066,<span style="color:white">0.7403914620000001</span>,0.0943704398]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The more people you have in a state the more senators and people you get in the house of representatives which means that the state gets more votes towards who gets elected.
