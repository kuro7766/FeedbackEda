Also every other spacecraft that landed on Venus only survied a couple of hours.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">My conclusion is that as much as us humans try to get up and personal with Venus it will never happend because of how dangerous it is.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">An explantion of the evidence is that Venus is to risky for astroughnaughts to study it. Really the only I say this that Venuses surface is the hottest out of all the planets. Venuses surface tempature averages 800 degress Fahrenheit.
