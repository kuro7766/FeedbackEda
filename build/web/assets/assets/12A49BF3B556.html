It would be expecially good for parents. Why? you might ask because, the students won't come home as early, and the parents will have time to run erin's and get some stuff done before their children get home. The parents will also be able to just have more time to their selves.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Also, <span style="color:orange">this could be helpful to the children mentally and physically.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Three out of four children and teens spend more than seven hours on their phone or watching television. These devises put out blue light into the the eye which is bad because, this can cause straining in the eye or even total blindness. when you are on your phone most of the time you have acess to the internet which means you can get on social media websites. When on websites like snapchat and instagram teens tend to compare their selves to others, and if they aren't up to par to look like "pretty" people they can get sad and form some type of depression.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Overall, students should build more life skills and social skills, and adding extracurricular activity's to the students day can help with that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">building life skills at a younger age can be great so, when you get out into the world you'll atleast know some key factors to living.
