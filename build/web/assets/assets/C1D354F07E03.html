<span style="color:yellow">It's the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, can you guess what it is? It's election day! Every four years, nearly every person in America will vote to choose a new President, or do we? Yes, we live in a democracy where we can vote for who runs out country, but do we really make the descision? The Electoral College is a phase where electors, of a candidate running for president, come together and decide for who is the President, Vice President, and include the countings of the electoral votes from Congress. The person who runs for President has a select group of people known as electors, which are typically chosen by that person's political party</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0148388172,0.1697447419999999,<span style="color:white">0.81541642</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Is this who we really vote for, and is it fair?

It could literally be anybody, not holding public office. This is not a direct way for us to vote for who makes the descisions around here. In "Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong," it claims that "...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now." Sixty percent said that!

Sometimes voters can't control who the electors vote for. This is both confusing and frustrating for anyone who thinks they voted for someone great, but the electors change that. In "Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong," it says that "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.", meaning that we don't choose for ourselves, they do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0130341174,0.235532724,<span style="color:white">0.75143316</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Some could say "its anarchy", or that "its not democratic", which could be true</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.0355139312,0.465831024,<span style="color:white">0.498655058</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">In "In defense of the Electoral College...," it states that "But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee...however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."
