dear principal, <span style="color:orange">I think you should allow us students to use cell phones during lunch</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">its our free time and we just wanna chat with friends and family</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . and <span style="color:orange">i know we are not allowed to use our phones</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  but <span style="color:orange">what happens if our family have a emergency and they need to get in touch with they son or daughter they can call or text and tell us was going on</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">but now sense we can use our phones our parents have to call the office and get in touch with her or him.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I know you don't like us using our cell phone</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  but <span style="color:orange">just give us a try to see how it works with us students. and if you don like it you can change it back</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> . but</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that would be a very cool idea if you let us do that. our cell phones are very important to us students</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  but <span style="color:white">i guess you don't realise it but its ok but we just need our cell phones to keep us busy while we are on our free time. and as soon as the bell ring to go to our next class we can turn off our phone but if you see our phones and we are using it u have the right to take it away.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Well I really think you should give us a try and see if it works but if it do it could or maybe stay that way. but I really think you should give us students a try and see if we can listen to the rules that u provided to us about our cell phones. and I know some of these students listen and some don't but if u try maybe something will work out for you and us students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
