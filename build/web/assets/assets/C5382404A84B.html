Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that u must have at least a B average to play a sport or activity is a bad rule</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0887817766,<span style="color:white">0.886306598</span>,0.0249116166]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">if someone is in a more challenging class then it is harder for them to get a higher grad.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.092350214,<span style="color:white">0.875714634</span>,0.0319351818]</span>  Also <span style="color:orange">maybe people need exercise and cant get it at home because they cant.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1129774012,<span style="color:white">0.8626593119999999</span>,0.0243632532]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Or they cant do any sport or activity because they cant afford it these are some tough times</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1491415371999999,<span style="color:white">0.8337180319999998</span>,0.0171404184999999]</span> . Now just listen to me for a little bit as I back up those reasons.</br></br><span style="color:orange">Say if someone is in a level 1 class and are struggling in that class because level 1 classes are more difficult than level 2 classes</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0816684574,<span style="color:white">0.886876422</span>,0.0314551098]</span> . <span style="color:white">What if this person really wanted to try out but could not play because there grade is a C plus and need a B average to play on the sport team that they wanted to play on. And what if another kid had straight A' s but could not play on a team because they had one C then they couldn't play on that team.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.143809032</span>,0.827664652,0.028526306]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">TEACHER_NAME what if there was a walking club at school and someone wanted to join the club because they needed to exercise</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1212147888,<span style="color:white">0.856158192</span>,0.0226269931999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">And that person really didn't want to get mad fun of anymore because they would get made fun of because they were big and lazy and they only had one bad grade and they couldn't do that just because they have one bad grade. So for my second reason that you have to have at least a B average.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.333365142,<span style="color:white">0.65517877</span>,0.01145608528]</span> </br></br>And lastly for my last reason <span style="color:orange">say someone wasn't the richest person in town and could afford for their child to play on a recreational team so they wanted to play on a school team. But had one or two horrible grades and couldn't play who knows he could be really good.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0900291388,<span style="color:white">0.8566831159999999</span>,0.0532877312]</span>  and finally that was my last reason for a child to play on a sports team or activity but must maintain a B average .</br></br><span style="color:white">Again i think that it is a terrible rule for a child to play on a team or activity and must maintain a B average.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.394118512</span>,0.600940238,0.00494126016]</span>
