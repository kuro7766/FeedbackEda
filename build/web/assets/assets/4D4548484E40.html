<span style="color:orange">Summer is a great time for self education. Student designed summer education is helpful because students are aware of their low points, should be a variable in their success, and should be working comfortably during the summer. Teachers may know a lot about their students, but no one understands the students like themselves. If a student is struggling on something, they can work on it as a project over the summer.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0429769946,<span style="color:white">0.604252904</span>,0.352770094]</span>  <span style="color:orange">As the student, it's your job to complete a task, and you should have no complaints over a project designed yourself.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.1276226586,<span style="color:white">0.6822607199999999</span>,0.1901166334]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">During the summer, students would need time to de-stress over school.

When I was younger, everyone would assume that I was just a kid and didn't understand that I was doing wrong. Although I may not have taken action upon it, I knew that not doing work or submitting to peer pressure was bad.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.213012377,<span style="color:white">0.6429476999999999</span>,0.1440399102]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Student's understand their faults and they know what they need to work on to fix them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0448882804,<span style="color:white">0.54430026</span>,0.41081143]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Knowing your faults is one thing, but acting upon them is important. Many students, when given a choice in their work, will choose not to work hard or procrastinate upon them. I can attest to this myself, as I set many self projects for myself that I do not complete. Students who are hard working and care about their grade will complete their goals.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1316684206</span>,0.63676134,0.2315702367999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Self made projects put the student in charge of their work and help them understand that they must complete it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0203366608999999,<span style="color:white">0.4987173739999999</span>,0.4809459539999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Summer is a break time off of school, therefore, students should not have to be given work that could be stressing or uncomfortable.
