<span style="color:yellow">The Electoral College was a compromise made by our founding fathers. It was made as a compromise between the election of a president through a vote from Congress and election through popular vote. The downside to this way of election is that the voters are not voting for one of the candidates but for their state electors, who then vote for the president. The votes from each of the states electors then count as votes for the candidate</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">This way of election for a president is unfair and confusing and should be changed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">First off, the Electoral College is unfair in the way that a vote from an individual does not really count because the only votes that really count are the ones from the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It is also unfair that the voters cannot always choose who they want thier electors to be. There are also voters who have no hope just because of the state they live in, such as Democrars in Texas or Republicans in California. Since they know that thier vote doesnt matter in a state whose majority of the population goes fot the opposing party. Thsi is one reason why individual votes are more reasonable and fair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Secondly, the Electoral College is very confusing for a voter who doesnt know how it works.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>
