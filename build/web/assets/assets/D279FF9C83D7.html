So basically if a said law is broken then the human gets the bad end of the deal, but if its a driverless car who will get the blame for a traffic law being broken the company that made it or the owner of the driverless car? Also in paprgraph 7 it basically said the car can drive its self unless if it needs human help and that the driver must always has his or her hands on the wheel. Basically saying we are able to regain control if needed, but what if we couldn't because the car is acting up and then we get injured or get others hurt.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.295013596,<span style="color:white">0.653428792</span>,0.0515575966]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So what I am trying to say is you never know if its safe.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1240393215999999,<span style="color:white">0.857557512</span>,0.0184031358]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So think about it.
