We haven't tried it again in a decade. The reason to this is that Temperatures vary around 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus has a thick atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide. If us humans even take a step on Venus we get crushed. Venus has a 90% atomic pressure, which is greater than what we have on Earth. It could even crush a submarine and those are supposed to outstand pressure from the ocean. Venus isn't a very pretty planet either, it has a familiar features as valleys,mountains, and craters</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.381523252,<span style="color:white">0.60680764</span>,0.01166912574]</span> . <span style="color:orange">We could use spacecraft to hover over venus about 30 miles or so above it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.2300765332,<span style="color:white">0.764834946</span>,0.00508847118]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Even if we did that we couldn't take sample rocks or gas</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.2660072,<span style="color:white">0.729838094</span>,0.0041546863]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Are technology gets better throughout the years, so maybe one day well figure a way out to oustand that heat and pressure</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.2232084459999999,<span style="color:white">0.77159464</span>,0.00519690594]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Even if we do that though, what would be the sense if we cant even live on the planet.
