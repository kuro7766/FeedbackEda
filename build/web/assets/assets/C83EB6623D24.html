Dear Principal, <span style="color:yellow">it would be very beneficial for our school to participate in community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">I see a community were there is no trash in the roads or fields, there are kids helping their elders, and even students wanting to help the community, this can be us.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Some of the activities that would easily be assessed are cleaning up trash</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  and <span style="color:yellow">caring for the elderly.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br>To begin, picking up trash would be good and easy to participate in <span style="color:yellow">because it can almost be treated like a field trip where students will be brought to a designated location where clean up is necessary and the students will clean up the roads and fields to have better land and less global warming because of the littered trash.</br></br>This form of community service would be easy because it would take less than two hours, so the kids can leave the school and come back in the blink of an eye.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br>Pursuing this further, another easy and good act of community service is looking after and taking care of the elderly.</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I believe this would be easy but a little more difficult to plan the picking up trash because the students will need to leave and come back from the homes of the elderly at different times so most if not all of the elderly citizens of our community can be helped and cared by the students at SCHOOL_NAME.</br></br>In a result there would be less fatalities of the elderly by falling because of the students with them to help care for them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">In Conclusion, I believe I will soon be able to see the day where our community is safe, where there is no global warming happening, where the streets and fields of our community are free of debris and the elderly are not frightened of getting too old where it is hard to see or walk because they will have children to rely on.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
