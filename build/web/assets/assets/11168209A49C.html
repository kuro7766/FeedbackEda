Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I am writing this letter to inform you that I do believe in your decision in making all the students of</br></br>SCHOOL_NAME to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think they should do it because community service it a great way to interact with younger children and the community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">There are all sorts of things to do from spending time with the young and elderly to cleaning the city.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Some students think that doing stuff like that is boring because their not getting paid.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">It doesn't matter who you are or what race you are it matter about everyone coming together as a family.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When you here the words community service you automatically think that its for bad people , but it's not</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I would describe community service as a chance to reach out to people. It's just not about cleaning up you can have fun raisers. You can also have community get-togethers to help support breast cancer or something like that</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">It really doesn't matter just show your community some love</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>  and I hope the students and teachers of SCHOOL_NAME understands that.</br></br>Yours Truly,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME:) *_*
