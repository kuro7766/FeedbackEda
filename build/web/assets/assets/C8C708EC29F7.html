This organization has taught me so much, such as life lessons, leadership skills, and team building strategies.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Secondly, <span style="color:orange">this is a great way for students to interact with others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In addition they can participate in sports, working on the yearbook, and the debate team. Sports, is a great way for you to get the exercise you need, becoming more social with others, and being competitive with other teams. Working on the yearbook is a great way for students to take pictures, edit on computers, and take part in the making of the the yearbook. Finally the debate team, this club is for students who are very opinionated, strong willed, and are not afraid of public speaking. This club is great for students who enjoy arguing against others and communication well with other teams.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Thirdly, Currier pathways options, this is a bonus to participating in at least one extracurricular activity. <span style="color:orange">You may decide to try something new and really enjoy it. In the future this could possibly be a Currier interest for you. For example if you choose yearbook, a Currier option for you could be photography. There are many options out there, but this one extracurricular activity you choose, could help you make that decision. On the other hand I would think about choosing one of these activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, <span style="color:orange">you should consider doing at least one extracurricular activity.
