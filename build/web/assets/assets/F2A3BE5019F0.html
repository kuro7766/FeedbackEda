Which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars. If something on the earth can have a mesa about or the same height had the face on mars it is very likely that it was a mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1258107378,<span style="color:white">0.84592359</span>,0.0282656552]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Secondly, shadows We all knows that shadows can be very deceiving just like in this instance</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1133696086,<span style="color:white">0.869049974</span>,0.0175804016]</span> . <span style="color:white">A shadow could have been reflecting off the viking 1 while it was taking this photo of the "Face", or maybe the shadows were from a bigger land form. that was infront, behind, or on the sides casting a shadow onto this mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.228825768</span>,0.76027322,0.01090099434]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">All in all, From these facts you can conclude that this was a natural landform and not some type of alien thing. If you still do not believe that it was natural. Another spaceship went into space and found the "Face" and took a very detailed picture and there were no markings or signs of aliens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.065925467,<span style="color:white">0.910114182</span>,0.0239603738]</span>
