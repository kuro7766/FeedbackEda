Some states are smaller then others so that makes them feel like their votes arent as important as the bigger states like California and Texas.

Every year a new generation becomes legal to vote and be part of the election but if they dont know how to vote or how it works then they wont be able to. Some people dont know anything about poitics but, still want to be able to vote so, it should be easy for them to vote for who they want to be president rather then the long process of, voting for the canidates elector and most of the time they dont vote for who they want and they vote for the wrong person.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0484072827999999,0.4520726479999999,<span style="color:white">0.499520046</span>]</span>
