<span style="color:orange">First of all studying venus isn't a bad idea wanting to explore the deepest point of venus can change history and life, we can figure out many secrets that venus has and what kind of life form could be on venus because in every planet their's always something that hasn't been discovered.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Venus is a planet that will soon be explored NASA has been sending spacecrafts to land on venus but they still don't make it,</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">For three decades many factors contribute to venus reputation and has been a challenge for humans to study,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  even thoe <span style="color:yellow">97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets venus and clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere and a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what we expirence on earth those conditions are way to extreme that humans don't encounter that on earth</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Another reason why it should be studied more and have future plans that someday people from NASA will land</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">is that because many astronomers believe that venus may have once been the most earth-like planet in our solar system and that venus was onced probably covered largely with oceans and could've been many forms of life in venus many many years ago.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Many scientist are looking for a way to get samples of rocks,gas,or anthing else that they can use to find out more about venus but they cannot do that</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">many researchers are working on innovations that will allow machines to last longer so they can get enough samples for them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Overall i think that finding new ways to explore and studie venus is a great idea i think that will change history maybe in the future venus can become our second home if we find out more about it and venus will soon be an explored planet and hope that will continue with other planets.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
