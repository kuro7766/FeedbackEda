<span style="color:white">In 2013, BMW announces the development of the "Traffic Jam Assistant". Been able to be comfortable and easier to drive but the driver has to be careful while driving. Be aware of everything that is going on the road; and we're the one who takes care of the car and not the car protecting us or feel more safer. I honestly think that we're the thinking more of the fashion or the style of the cars, and become more less careful on the protection of our own. We have to think more of the protection and make cars more safer to feel and comfortable. The driver is not going to feel safer, but it's also going to convince the driver to drive more safer. According to "driverless cars are coming' people are going to focus on laws that is going to keep drivers,passengers,and pedestrians safe.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">More cars are going to make and more style are going to make; but I also want to be safe when I'm in a car.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span>
