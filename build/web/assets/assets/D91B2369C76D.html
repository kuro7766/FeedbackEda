Dear TEACHER_NAME</br></br><span style="color:orange">I would like to say that doing community service is a good thing, but i do not think you should require the whole school to do it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0377424772,<span style="color:white">0.8382000599999999</span>,0.1240574754]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Reason are that because some student may not have time to do it student may plan out of town trips with family,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0518348782,<span style="color:white">0.8773899220000001</span>,0.0707751772]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I believe that you should let students have a choice in what they do. Some students may not have rides to go to the community service areas. If you really want us you to do community services you should make a club in the school and those student who joins are really going to be the ones that commits to helping the community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1146985007999999,<span style="color:white">0.814107914</span>,0.0711936158]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Reasons why i think you shouldn't require community service because some of us really just want to sleep in the mornings and hang out with friends in the evening we really don't get that in school</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1084125368</span>,0.8177047419999999,0.0738827096]</span> . <span style="color:white">We should not be punished because we don't have the time to help the community. Most student would like too help the community you should look out for those types and ask them and not require the whole school that would be a little too much for some students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1864813766</span>,0.767632874,0.0458857562]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">In conclusion i believe that you as the principle should hold a school wide meeting discussing about helping the community and making a community service club and those that want to join are the one that will do the community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.342556844</span>,0.63186856,0.02557460834]</span> . i think this i
