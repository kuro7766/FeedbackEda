<span style="color:orange">Scientist are interested in exploring Venus but they find it very hard to explore it. Venus has high temperature that make it harder for them to be able to get a closer look at it which makes it a challenge for scientists for to even get a closer look at it. If Venus is Earth's sister planet why is it so inhospitable for us to live in it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.243922408,<span style="color:white">0.7519030059999999</span>,0.0041745915]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Why are scientist wasting their time trying to explore it and how would we know what is actually in Venus if we haven't yet explored it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.34528121</span>,0.652830318,0.00188844004]</span>  <span style="color:white">I think it may be a bit to dangerous for any of us to actually be able to explore it without the right equipment and the right person to send there without knowing for sureif they would be getting hurt or not.
