Phones and driving</br></br><span style="color:orange">Do you believe texting and drive is bad and can cause car accidents or any terrible thing to happen? Honestly doing any like that can lead to no common sense especially when you have someone in the car with you. Over thousands of people die from a car accident situation which unlikely happy for love one's. I feel like more of this comes from young adults and teens because there still in that developing stage where this and that needs to be learned. Even though, car accidents happen you shouldn't be scared to drive or stop you from driving.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0944777122,<span style="color:white">0.856916168</span>,0.0486061032]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">You should just be a lot safer than other with driving.

People always make excuses as soon as an accident happens with them. They try to say they were getting something that fell or telling one of there passengers in the back to stop knowing all they have to say is i was texting.</br></br>I feel like we should have this thing in the future where we get in the car our phones automatically turn off so then there would be no problem with anything. I say this because it's better than doing that one stupid thing then risking however many lives are in thart car.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0574813511999999,<span style="color:white">0.8929754400000001</span>,0.0495432483999999]</span> </br></br>https://www. dmv. org/distracted-driving/texting-and-driving. php https://www. icebike. org/texting-and-driving/
