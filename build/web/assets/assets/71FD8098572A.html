<span style="color:orange">Have you ever just wondered if there could be life somewhere else from earth?</br></br>If so then how about the face that they found on mars. Many people dont agree that it's just landform that built it's self up and just happened to resembul a face. Others would disagree and say that it is just land and that shodows were the main purpose of the enitre thing that made it look like a face. Why did the face on mars not look the same in 1976 i looked like a smilly face at first.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.201311956,<span style="color:white">0.7837295080000001</span>,0.0149585352]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">When the picuture was taken it was taken in many different angles.

Makeing it appear like something that is not really there. Garvin says that it remindes him of a lava dome around the America West it's about the same height as the face that they found on mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.15354519,<span style="color:white">0.8359397</span>,0.0105151169]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">When they first took a picture of the face in 1976 it looked nothing like a face it only looked like a smily face and even that was hard to tell. After a couple of years in 1998 in looked like an oval shaped box and it was sunken in. And in 2001 is when started to shape into something over the years in changed and over more years it will change even more.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.317718136,<span style="color:white">0.677892772</span>,0.00438908878]</span>  <span style="color:orange">After that and so on because that's just what landforms do they change but, you can't always see the same thing you sole once.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.257509718,<span style="color:white">0.73836666</span>,0.00412361174]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I can see why some people don't see why it could be a landform And that its actually something else it does look like a face .it could actually be a statue and not just land shaped in to something but the thing is of it was really a statue or remaines of something or someone</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.219259074,<span style="color:white">0.775226854</span>,0.0055140545]</span>  <span style="color:white">But,then why wouldn't it looks fuler or have actuale face there would be bones.
