Another approach is <span style="color:orange">mechanical computers</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">which, "were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II." This device does not require electronics and they "make calculations by using gears and levers." Any regular, modern computer if exposed to acid or heat are capable of melting, as well as cell phones and tablets. This shows that devices that use mechanical parts can tend to be more resistant to such pressure, heat, and other forces.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I have concluded that though it is risky and dangerous to study Venus, I think it's worth knowing about it and it's contents. It's a great challenge for us humans but that is what makes it worth knowing about. What if Venus excedes our expectations and we find something that could possibly be life impacting? I think the danger and doubt would be worth it and our thoughts and assumptions would rest at ease.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
