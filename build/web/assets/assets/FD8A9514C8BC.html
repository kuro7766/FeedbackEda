<span style="color:orange">Not too long ago I got into a disagreement with one of my best friends, this made me a little sad. But something that always helped me feel better was talking to trusted people about it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Receiving opinions from multiple people can help someone decide on a better choice</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:yellow">they can view the other persons perspective,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">they will get honest feedback,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  and <span style="color:yellow">they might find out more information on the situation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br>Getting advice from different people can help you see multiple perspectives on the situation. <span style="color:yellow">The trusted person helping you can show you how the other person might be feeling. Sometimes knowing how they feel can change your point of view on things. The friend or family member can inform you on what you did wrong. Even if the opposing person hurt your feelings, there is a high chance you have hurt them as well! If you are confused on what the problem is they can show you what it is or how it started. For me, I need to understand how the problem started before I resolve it. Understanding how the other person felt, knowing what the problem is, and realizing what you did wrong are important things the trusted people helping you can do for you to make a better choice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br>The person you are seeking advice from can inform you with more facts about the situation. <span style="color:yellow">They might have gone through the same thing in the past and know how to handle it. I feel a sense of relief to know that they understand what I am going through. If you are talking to a friend they will most likely already know about the situation and can help you out more than you think. Depending on how much they know, you'll have a clear understanding of what happened and feel comfortable enough to make a good decision. Another way you can get more knowledge is figuring out how you can prevent this from happening again in the future. That is something you're gonna need! Getting advice from someone who already knows about the problem, has dealt with the same thing in the past, and keeping the advice for the future are perfect reasons why you should seek advice from not just one person, but a few.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br>Lastly, the trusted person who is helping you will give you honest feedback. <span style="color:yellow">They will help you choose the best way to handle the situation. It always makes me feel better when the person giving me advice knows how to help me. The person can tell you if your choice is the best or not. You will most likely feel better after getting "the okay" from another person. Talking to a trusted person will make you feel more comfortable, especially knowing you aren't getting lied to. By then you will feel ready to make a great choice. Knowing if your decision is good or not, being told how to handle it, and talking to someone who won't lie to you will truly help you decide on a better choice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Asking people for advice can sometimes help you make a better choice. Viewing other peoples perspective, getting more information on the topic, and getting honest feedback can help you decide on a better choice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>  Do you thing talking to more than one person can help you make a better choice?
