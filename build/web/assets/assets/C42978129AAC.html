Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think you should use policy 1 for several reasons.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0988231058,<span style="color:white">0.8834773739999999</span>,0.01769951462]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If someone needs a ride after school and there are no cell phones, there will be no way to communicate with your parents or get any help.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0334411686,<span style="color:white">0.867686688</span>,0.098872116]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Cell phones should be turned off in class though.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0948813404,<span style="color:white">0.8848426760000001</span>,0.02027600512]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I see many people with their phones under their desks and that is not okay.

They aren't a bad thing. They are amazingly useful and they are only bad when they are used in class. Cell phones are great for communicating. You can talk to someone anywhere at anytime for free. If you need help or are in a car accident, you can just use your cell phone and they will help you.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.2313415919999999</span>,0.749281908,0.0193764692]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If you use policy 1 as your guide line, I expect you to not change any single word to the policy. You will expect us to not use them in class or anywhere at school other than at lunch or other free times. Thank you for reading this message and I hope you agree with me.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.2160287698,<span style="color:white">0.7640740880000001</span>,0.0198971472]</span> </br></br>Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
