<span style="color:white">My Principal wants to change that we must have a B average to be in any sport.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">My opinion is No,</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because a student might not get a subject therefore that student has a lower average.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It is also hard to maintain a B average when being in a sport because you are worried about both grades and that sport and also maybe things that are going on in your life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br>But <span style="color:orange">maintaining a B average can also help you</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If you are in a sport, you say to yourself "hey if I keep my grade to a B average, then i can stay in my sport. " That to me is what helps most kids or teens that are in a sport . I could also see why my principal would change the grade is, because he/she has more students trying out for sports and also that he needs a good grading report from all of his students and half of his students are in a sport so that is why.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>So therefore <span style="color:orange">maintaining good grades would help a lot not just to the students but also to the school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">More students need to pay more attention to school so they can be in sports.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Sports is a great way for students to get a great education and to maybe someday get a scholarship to college</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">That would make me very happy if i got a scholarship to college from having great grades and for being in sport</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  that is what i think would be best.</br></br>Thank you for your time,</br></br>Your Students
