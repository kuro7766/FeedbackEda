Dear Principle,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I think that students should have the choice to do community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">I think the only time a student should be forced to do community service is when their being punished.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Most students might have too much to do for community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">If there too busy doing community service the students might not be able to take care of there more important responsibilities. Students might have homework or house chores to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think you should let the students that want to do community service do it</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">If they're always doing community service, when will the students be able to have time to enjoy for themselves. Doing community service takes a lot of time out of a persons day. If there was a test a student had to take the next day after doing community service when schools over and if that student spent a lot of time to do that, then when that student got home, he would be restless and probably wouldn't have enough time to study for that test. I just don't think that community service is healthy for a lot of kids learning environments</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So, this concludes my theory on students doing community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely yours, STUDENT_NAME
