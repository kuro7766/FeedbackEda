They was lucky that happen , consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Perhaps the most worrying thin is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.366571032,<span style="color:white">0.62253578</span>,0.01089318732]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college is unfair,outdated, and irrational. The arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality, and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. There's five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president and those five reasons is certainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, big states, and avoid run-off elections.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.3931028179999999,<span style="color:white">0.600862548</span>,0.0060346401]</span>  <span style="color:white">These five reasons have something to deal with Electoral College.

I think that it doesn't because they have arguments about it ,about they dont get that much votes. And that something is wrong with the electoral college. People should decide on what they want and that voters can control whom their electors vote! It can be a argued that the electoral college method of selecting the presisdent may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying thier state. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.307846652,<span style="color:white">0.6786816999999999</span>,0.01347165774]</span>
