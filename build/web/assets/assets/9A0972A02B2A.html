Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">Imagine, not being able to play in the biggest basketball game of your life because your grades were not as good as the principal would expect them to be</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">I find it very unfair that students are not allowed to participate in school sports or other activities with a C average.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Interpreting this law may cause many conflicts such as making a sport team not do as well</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">and affect the students future</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> .</br></br>To begin, <span style="color:yellow">not allowing the students to play in the game may cause the team to lose an important game</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">In Red Silver, New Jersey, RELATIVE_NAME, who was very good at basketball was unable to play in the championship game because his grades weren't that well. As the game was close come to the fourth quarter,</br></br>RELATIVE_NAMEs team couldn't hold onto the game. RELATIVE_NAME was averaging 22.9 points a game, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists, and those statistics in the championship could've made his team possibly win as they lost by 20 points. RELATIVE_NAME missed being eligible for the game by one point in his average.</br></br>His average was an 82, which is a C, and</br></br>B average is an 83. RELATIVE_NAME missing the championship game affected his team for the worst, as the Red</br></br>Silver could've won its first basketball championship ever.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also, having a C average can affect your future greatly.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">RELATIVE_NAME, tall and corpulent, was very good at football, yet not a great student. RELATIVE_NAME was being scouted by Division1 scouts from colleges such as Florida. Being a C+ student was his only fear from making the "big colleges" in the nation. In Maui, RELATIVE_NAME dominated the football season. Unfortunately, he was forced to sit out of the biggest game in his career because he was not academically eligible. RELATIVE_NAME was affected so greatly on this incident, all of his Division1 scholarships were gone because the scouts didn't want a student like RELATIVE_NAME in the school. RELATIVE_NAME was not very intelligent, but if he was to have someone tutor him, he would've went to any college he wanted to go to.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, <span style="color:yellow">i think that maintaining a C average to play on the school sports team or other activities the school offers. RELATIVE_NAME and RELATIVE_NAME</br></br>both were affected off of this negatively as they could have had potential in going far in life. So in my opinion, i think that the principal should let students participate in school sports, as long as they get help in the subjects they are struggling in.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective]</span>  Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.</br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>A student
