The only problem is there isnt technolgy good enough to render photos that are taken from the ground below. There fore if they really want smaples and all that thye have to get on the ground. Its survivable but the conditions are harsh and challenging.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.3508700379999999,<span style="color:white">0.645459904</span>,0.0036700740199999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The author then wraps up the story talking about how we strive to meet these challenges and where it can lead us</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.518564986,<span style="color:white">0.48016265</span>,0.0012723556839999]</span> <span style="color:orange">. I feel like we should amd should be able to study Venus from a close range. I think the dangers can be overcomed with lots of training and simulations that are inspried by Venus's harsh condistions. I also belive that we can survie venus with good technology.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.126975212,<span style="color:white">0.8633533979999999</span>,0.00967135056]</span>  <span style="color:white">I know we have it we just done want to release it into the world which makes sense but at the same time we could have billions of people living on 2 differnt planets.
