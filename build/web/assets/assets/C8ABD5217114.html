Thesis: Disagreeing on having to participate in atleast one extracurricular activity.</br></br><span style="color:orange">There's alot of extracurricurricular actiivitys you can participate in , but some people don't like to participate in activity's. Some of them can be boring making people not want to do them. Then theres some people that love doing activitys like that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It shouldn't be up to the principal if they want to participate in them or not.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There is just some people that can't participate in things like sports</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  , <span style="color:orange">if doing extracurricular activitys could help peoples grades then i think the people that aren't interested in doing them would be more interested then. But for now they're just for fun and now days teenagers just want to hangout with friends and be on their phone.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There is some people that barely get to spend time with their family because they're so busy so they don't have time for activitys.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">With sports being a extracurricular activity there is some people that can't afford is</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because it can be exspincve and some kids/families don't have the money for that. Theres some kids that would love to do things like sports , but don't have transpartion or money and some schools don't always have rides for students to get back and forth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Some students can't participate in things like that because they get in to much trouble</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">*they only do it like that at some schools*</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I don't really see a point of having to do a extracrricular activity theres just no point. I don't think trying it once would hurt to see if you like it or not! If our principal made us do this i feel like it should be once a mouth because other people have other things to do and are busy , and i feel like the students should be able to pick what activity they want to do or not. And the teachers should put it in as a grade if they participate or not.</br></br>End of teh story , i think theres no point in extracurricular activitys.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
