The picture on Mars was found to be what looked like the face of an Egyptian god. The pictures taken were blurry but showed to actually be a face indicating there was life on Mars sometime in the past or even here in the present.

But in this picture, the so called mask just looked like a normal everyday landform. The media was not happy with this picture.
