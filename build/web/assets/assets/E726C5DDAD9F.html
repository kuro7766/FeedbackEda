Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I believe everyone should be required to do at least 24 hours of community service each year.</br></br>That's adds up to only one day of your 365 day year.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0029835841199999,0.155711528,<span style="color:white">0.8413049340000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">It is not asking for a lot from the us to sacrifice one day.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0068819526199999,0.233041392,<span style="color:white">0.76007666</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">I think if you want to do more than 24 hours of service, go right ahead that would be even better.</br></br>If 1,000 students each help out for a day, that would be 24,000 hours of community service!</br></br>That could make a huge impact in our community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00893587934,0.191042018,<span style="color:white">0.800022108</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I know some people would still disagree and not do this, but as a second option you can make them do a large project that would take them a lot longer than a day.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.00862780662,<span style="color:white">0.1864893499999999</span>,0.8048828539999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">I don't know too many people that would much rather do a huge project rather than sacrifice a total of two, maybe three whole days to help out their community.</br></br>It wouldn't take long at all.</br></br>It could be as easy as picking up some trash in the local park or, if you want to you can be able to tutor kids or help out kids with a disability.</br></br>Either way, you are going to help out the community in a positive way.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00520128088,0.110058331,<span style="color:white">0.88474042</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Just imagine, what we could be able to do if our whole school were to chip in 24 hours of community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00381151258,0.168941972,<span style="color:white">0.82724649</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">We could do so much if we were to put this rule into our school program.</br></br>I do community service every year just to help out the community without being required to do it.</br></br>I have cleaned up the park, helped make sandwiches for the homeless, helped kids with disabilities.</br></br>I can only imagine how much this could change our community if everybody in our school were required to do this.</br></br>People that we would be helping would be so grateful.</br></br>We as a school could become the school that everyone talks so greatly about.</br></br>We could start promoting this idea around school by hanging posters up, handing out flyers, reminding people on the morning and afternoon announcements.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.001657996988,0.0543308602,<span style="color:white">0.94401114</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">If you get behind my idea, I know students and teachers will follow us and make a huge difference in our community.</br></br>We could even send out e-mails to each student's parents telling them of this idea.</br></br>If the parents find out about this, I believe they will certainly force their kids to take part in a small amount of community service.</br></br>All I am asking from you, is to just enforce this one little rule into our school.</br></br>It could change lives.</br></br>I am not asking for everybody to do a whole lot, just 24 hours of your life to help out the community.</br></br>There are so many opportunities for our students to help out our community.</br></br>Who knows, maybe you could save somebody's life while doing the community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0008276747399999,0.0380944656,<span style="color:white">0.961077842</span>]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
