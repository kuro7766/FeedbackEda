Dear Principle of my School,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I realize that you have been wondering if you should require all students to perform community service. In this letter i am going to give my opinion on what i think.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.1628221532,<span style="color:white">0.629863236</span>,0.20731462]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">In my opinion, i think you should make all students perform some type of community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.01613566794,0.478653674,<span style="color:white">0.505210696</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I think this is a good idea so that students will be more involved in their community</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0144748067799999,0.48757615,<span style="color:white">0.497949054</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">and so that our community will become a better one.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0224489863,0.454669686,<span style="color:white">0.52288133</span>]</span> </br></br>First, i think this is a good idea because students will be more involved in their community. <span style="color:orange">For example, if students all come together to work they will become more aware of their own homes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.124807822,<span style="color:white">0.6561005740000001</span>,0.219091625]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Students may even meet new people and get to know more people who live in the area.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0946402671999999,<span style="color:white">0.674153558</span>,0.2312061834]</span> </br></br>Second, this is also a good idea because our community will improve. With more people volunteering and helping our community will improve. <span style="color:orange">One thing that could happen is our area will become cleaner. Because of this, there could be more people walking or more business.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1026752990999999,<span style="color:white">0.627795388</span>,0.269529296]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Lastly, i would like to explain that i also think that not every student should participate in certain community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.108497711</span>,0.514430232,0.377072058]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think this because sometimes not all students may have time to help with bigger service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.159765916,<span style="color:white">0.6603626119999999</span>,0.1798714952]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some students may not even want to help.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1800575206,<span style="color:white">0.659673312</span>,0.1602691508]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think that we should only let people that are willing to help perform community service help with bigger projects.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2545213699999999,<span style="color:white">0.58111531</span>,0.164363308]</span>  I hope that this letter means something and it is taken under consideration.</br></br>Thanks, STUDENT_NAME
