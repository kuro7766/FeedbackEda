Dear Principle of my School,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I realize that you have been wondering if you should require all students to perform community service. In this letter i am going to give my opinion on what i think.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">In my opinion, i think you should make all students perform some type of community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I think this is a good idea so that students will be more involved in their community</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">and so that our community will become a better one.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br>First, i think this is a good idea because students will be more involved in their community. <span style="color:orange">For example, if students all come together to work they will become more aware of their own homes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Students may even meet new people and get to know more people who live in the area.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Second, this is also a good idea because our community will improve. With more people volunteering and helping our community will improve. <span style="color:orange">One thing that could happen is our area will become cleaner. Because of this, there could be more people walking or more business.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Lastly, i would like to explain that i also think that not every student should participate in certain community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think this because sometimes not all students may have time to help with bigger service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some students may not even want to help.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think that we should only let people that are willing to help perform community service help with bigger projects.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  I hope that this letter means something and it is taken under consideration.</br></br>Thanks, STUDENT_NAME
