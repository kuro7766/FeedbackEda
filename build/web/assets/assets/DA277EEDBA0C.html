The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President, that can sum up if someone wins or loses, a big disadvantage in the longrun. Over 60% of voters would perfer a direct election, if we got that voters would not be pressured at all and would have a very good vote that can be proud of.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.413889794,<span style="color:white">0.537643948</span>,0.048466231]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There all lots of things wrong with the Electoral College System in my opinon, like that when you vote for your President, your also choosing the electors that come along with him/her.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0980842018,<span style="color:white">0.803486648</span>,0.098429141]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There have way over the amount of problems with electors over the past year and it is a huge problem that only some people have noticed.

The Electoral College System is messing our society up every 4 years, its unfair, outdated, and irrational in so many ways. For an example, in the 2000 U.S presidential race, Al Gore received more indiviual votes then George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. Don't get me wrong Bush was a great president, but facts are facts.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.280546898,<span style="color:white">0.664116576</span>,0.0553365062]</span>
