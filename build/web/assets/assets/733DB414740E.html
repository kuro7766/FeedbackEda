Dear Principle,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that students should be required to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So that instead of students always doing things for themselves they should do something for someone else for a change.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  I <span style="color:orange">will say this to all the students.</br></br>Why stay in the house all day playing video games, doing nothing, just watching television? When you could be helping someone in need or help the environment get healthy</br></br>One way you can help your community is by planting a tree, giving food to the homeless, volunteering at an animal shelter or a homeless shelter.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">You maybe want to change your life</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  but <span style="color:orange">help someone change theirs. How would you feel if you really needed help or wanted to make a change but no one will help you and no one will support you in any way what so ever, what do you think will happen to you if your homeless or don't have enough oxygen because you never tried to plant a tree not a day in your life?</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Don't think for a second that there isn't a person animal or plant the doesn't need your help!</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
