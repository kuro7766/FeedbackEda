To. Principal,</br></br><span style="color:white">My opinion about this change is a good idea</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">But also many students have a grade of a (C)</br></br>or lower it would not be a good idea changing the policy sport grade for those students</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">For others this policy my be a good idea because that way students that love sport's can start doing much better in school and have better grades</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">A, (B) or higher is a good grade so that way they can play a sport they like.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Teachers would probably accept this policy so that way their students will pay more attention.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This change would not effect much but for students who don't study this idea might not be good,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">might fill bad because they love sport's but can't play them for having to not pay attention or do your work at home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Instead <span style="color:orange">we should vote to see if we like this policy or not so we wont have to pass thru all this stuff of the policy changing</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">A fact about students here in SCHOOL_NAME would choose not to accept this new school policy because the old policy is u can't have more than three (F) and i would say the old policy is better than the new one our principal want to change it to</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So if i pick my own decision it would be no changing policy and its good as it is</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:white">the policy they should really change is having to no wear uniform to school because its such a distraction to me an much others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
