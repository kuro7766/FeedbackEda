The president should not be determined by a couple people here and a couble people there. It should be determined by everybody that lives in america. Not a individual state.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.251216572,<span style="color:white">0.6944241879999999</span>,0.054359214]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The biggest problem here is that we (america) are so much more advanced then the system we have right now.

The advances weve made in so many aspects of goverment are not being translated into the electoral college.
