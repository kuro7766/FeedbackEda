<span style="color:orange">Taking a deep breath in a city filled with cars and buses, people would be inhaling all the emissions giving off by the heavy duty use of cars. Taking in smog is like breathing in dirt. Changes around the world are taking place to accomodate to the impacts caused by cars. In the twenty-first cenury, cars are a must to get from place to place.

In Europe, cities are taking the step forward by creating a city where it is difficult to obtain a car. According to</br></br>Source 1:</br></br>"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars," by Elisabeth Rosenthal, explains the main motive why cities are making it difficlt to use cars, which is, "Its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accesible to public transprtation, with less space for parking." This means, that by making it a struggle to obtain a car, it would help promote others to use public transportation or another method, which at the end of the day, would benefit the environment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0115401664,<span style="color:white">0.264665914</span>,0.723793924]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Last but not least, the culture of the world is constanly changing day by day.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.0311923738</span>,0.45453671,0.514270916]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In the twenty-first century, technology has taken over the lives of many. From apps to the internet, the changes are inevitable thanks to the breakthrough in technology.  In</br></br>Source 4:</br></br>"The End of Car Culture," by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University, explains,"Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift." Mimi is talking about the recent decline of automobile sales occuring which mean less and less people are buying cars. She believes the reason behind the decline is due to the culture in which involves technology. Moreover, she goes on to say," Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work." Again and again technology proves to be a saving factor in this world to humans, and in this case it is saving humans from injurying the only home it has. With the easy access of calling someone up for a ride or searching up public transportation near by, allows the environment to be fresher and cleaner, as well as, it allows humans to interact with one another without having to drive to that person's house.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.022041308,<span style="color:white">0.17391412</span>,0.8040445820000001]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Movements take place to improve what seems to be a problem.

Improvements shown in places like Paris, shows how the limiting of automobile usage can greatly impact the envrionment to create a clean atmosphere. Not only would it help clear smog, but it would allow a stress free city from being populated by traffic jams and yelling individuals, who are experiencing road rage thanks to the taffic. A happier environment would be created when people are out rding bikes to places and walking with friends. In cocnclusion, the benifits of limiting car usage are as clear as water, it would reduce smog, promote other forms of transprtation, and would help our culture by creating a happier, cleaner atmosphere to live in.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0091663875,0.302907404,<span style="color:white">0.687926182</span>]</span>
