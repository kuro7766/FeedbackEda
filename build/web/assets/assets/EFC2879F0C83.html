Or, perhaps ironically so, lack therfore of directly selecting a President. It is this particular topic that has inquired me to send you this letter regarding the upcoming debate: Should the Electoral College Stay Or Go?</br></br>Now don't get me wrong here: I legitimately don't believe anything I say could really have a major impact on any type of consideration towards this debate, I just hope you read this and ponder it's words to fully make a positive choice-whichever path you choose to side with in this.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.1611600682,0.27634396,<span style="color:white">0.562495968</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Our Forefathers created the Electoral College because they believed it to be the best method in securing a true democratic result for the leader of the USA.
