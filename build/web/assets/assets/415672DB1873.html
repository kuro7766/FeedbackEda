A lot or students may agree with this policy just b. cause it have has 2 involve cells phones and we just want 2 use them cells phone are good in some ways 2 bring them 2 school and in other ways they are not every body has there own opinion.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Thank you STUDENT_NAME</br></br>for listening 2 my opinion on this cell phone rule in our school!
