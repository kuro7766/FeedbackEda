<span style="color:orange">The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," stated that meeting the challenge of exploring Venus is valuable because it will provide more knowledge of the planet, but also because humans will be curious about many dangerous things in the future. The author stated many dangers and doubts of exploring the planet, but then described solutions that may or may not work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.00658765432,<span style="color:white">0.1930258819999999</span>,0.8003864820000001]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">It is contradictive that he decided to include facts and data that went against his own thoughts because he came back and listed data that went against the negative statements.

He said that we know that Venus has many similar structures to Earth, such as mountains, valleys, and craters. If Venus is Earth's "twin," doesn't mean that it is extremely similar to Earth? The statement could make people curious about how close Venus really is to Earth, or it could make them wonder why we should bother risking people's safety if we already know that Venus is just like Earth</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0212084315,0.2451144582,<span style="color:white">0.7336771059999999</span>]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The author needed to be clearer on which way he wanted people to view that statement</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0353738232,<span style="color:white">0.4270692</span>,0.5375569600000001]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:yellow">The author also brought up the dangers of visiting Venus multiple times.

He later stated that NASA has a possible idea to send blimp-like vehicles to travel the surface of Venus, but that would not provide a detailed enough view of the ground.

He then said, "The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers..." It is irrelevant to the message when the mechanical computers were envisioned or the fact that it is shocking to hear that computers existed in 1940. It was hard to understand why computers were important to the article at all. The author made it difficult to focus on the message when he was stating random facts that were not important to the idea he was trying to support.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00722620322,0.1341414343999999,<span style="color:white">0.8586323800000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The author did not make it extremly obvious as to what he was truly trying to convey. If he would been more clear and less contradictive, then it would have been more obvious that he supports the idea that Venus is worthy of being explored. Also, it would have been easier to understand the point he was trying to put across if he would have stayed on topic throughout the article. The message of the article should be obviously supported by the author.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.00580084608,0.1703654008,<span style="color:white">0.823833738</span>]</span>
