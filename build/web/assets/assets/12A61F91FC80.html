Knowing when a person is feeling sad, angry, happy, etc, can really be great for if they need someone to talk to. It could make things better or make things not so good. Just having those options of emotions to be recognized is something very amazing. Even though this system can't contol your emotions or thoughts, it can really help to understand when there is something good or bad going on.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1185213,<span style="color:white">0.8558717100000001</span>,0.025606982]</span> </br></br>In the conclusion to figuring out if this new technology system is valuable, it most certainly is. It can be useful in many ways. <span style="color:orange">I think another use for this could be in hospitals to detect if a patient is lying about their emotions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0745789808,<span style="color:white">0.906475964</span>,0.0189450683999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Even though a patient in a hospital may not like this because it can see their true emotions, it might be able to help them in the long run. If this technology can help manage what another person is feeling then it can make them see whats really going on, even if they lie about it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0883836038,<span style="color:white">0.891393628</span>,0.0202227624]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The computer will construct a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an "action unit." Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. All of humans show the same facial expressions but maybe some at different times. The Mona Lisa demonstration is intened to bring a smile to our face, while it shows just how much this computer can do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.6064540039999999</span>,0.3877609999999999,0.00578497958]</span>
