Scientists tried working around it without landing something on it sinse it just gets distroyed while trying to collect data for scientists and hovering something over the planet didnt even work for them. Trying to build a divice to be able to land and last long enough is extremly hard for people for the fact that they have not and cannot land and survive Venus. unable to collect a rock and gas sample make things harder sense they dont know what chemicals are being used against they forces they are trying to take there.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.786435112,<span style="color:white">0.2104685968</span>,0.0030962646199999]</span>  <span style="color:white">I believe that the body of this should be faced not feared.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.749667252</span>,0.2496339819999999,0.000698785396]</span>
