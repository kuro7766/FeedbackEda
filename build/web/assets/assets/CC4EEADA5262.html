They will only cause problems, because they can easily get into accidents, among many other issues. It was just spoken about this week in the news: Google's car got into its first accident.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1000011586</span>,0.7337990999999999,0.166199744]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In order to completely transfer over to driverless cars, a lot of things have to be changed and developed</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0744287706,<span style="color:white">0.7116127760000001</span>,0.2139584268]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Not only are the cars themselves problematic (they are not even able to react around an accident site), but there are no laws stating who is responsible if a vehicle with no driver causes an accident to happen. Who is held responsible in the end? A prediction some can make is that many lawsuits will be formed against both the maker of the vehicle, and the driver behind the wheel. The question will also arise that if neither were in control, can you blame something such as a car?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.06784577932,<span style="color:white">0.6087032280000001</span>,0.323450998]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Another problem that the cars could create, is a huge spending issue</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0510143427,<span style="color:white">0.6900219400000001</span>,0.2589637379999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">In the article it is stated that a certain device "cost two hundred million dollars." That is a lot of money to spend on the system for one car. And the cars need many sensors in order for them to run smoothly, such as," a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors," and that might be roughly half of all one car needs.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1129185158,<span style="color:white">0.672878816</span>,0.2142026669999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Another problem that could arise is the conditions of roads.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0406933856999999,<span style="color:white">0.6613123080000001</span>,0.297994308]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Many of the driverless cars that the article states have been developed have needed specific conditions in order to function correctly, such as "a special test track" or "magnets with alternating polarity." How would those cars function in an everyday situation out on the open road? Not very well. So how would they be able to develop a vehicle that can operate on a true highway, as well as on the many other types of roadways in the world?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0595776298,<span style="color:white">0.653087052</span>,0.287335306]</span>  <span style="color:orange">An issue that should be brought up also, is that none of the developed vehicles have been completely driverless.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0457092553999999,<span style="color:white">0.6621581200000001</span>,0.292132626]</span>  <span style="color:white">They need humans to do certain things for them behind the wheel, such as navigating crash scenes.

They will only create trouble that is not needed in the world, and can possibly lead to way bigger issues, such as in our economy. The development and actual distribution of these cars would be something unprecedented and who knows what could come of unprecedented things. In reading this article, it was easy to pick out things that could go wrong, and reasons it would not be in the world's best interest to go further in the development, but it was a lot harder to pick out what could go right and how these cars could help the world. If something might do more harm than good, why do it?</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0419248728,0.490346164,<span style="color:white">0.467728948</span>]</span>
