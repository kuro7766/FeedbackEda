Dear state senator,</br></br><span style="color:white">I think that every person who wants to go for president should go to electoral school, just so when ever the person runs for president they don't win because they are well known and popular vs the other person who is not well known.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Also if they do go to election school they could learn how to run for pesident and learn how to write speeches, and also teach them that some of the 50 states in the united states have to have his/her vote.</br></br>The out come of a person running for president that went to electoral school their electoral vote will be above average for one year and if they do good as president then the outcome for next year will maybe bet higher or lower. When ever a US citizen votes they are also voting for the electors canidates. and when you do vote that person who is running for president that helps his/her's group get elected. Every president has to have a Vice president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>
