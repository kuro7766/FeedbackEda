These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus." This piece of text from the passage shows that if anything were to happen to Earth, Venus would be our closet option for a planetary visit because Venus is one of our planetary neighbors and closet to Earth at times.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1106817092,<span style="color:white">0.5582559</span>,0.331062408]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Secondly, we should continue studying Venus because it will allow us to learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.01277949806,0.361884504,<span style="color:white">0.6253359680000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">In paragraph three the text illustrates,"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."
