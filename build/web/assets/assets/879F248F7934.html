Dear, State Senator</br></br>Hi, State Senator my name is PROPER_NAME and <span style="color:orange">i think you should stay with Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">because the Electoral college is a process not a place</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Stated in paragraph 1 it says " The founding fathers establsihed it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualifed citzens"</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So in my owns i think what was stated means it should be a tradition and it should stay as a tradition in the American culture</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. With that being said that is just like saying you are choosing a president by the most popular votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In paragraph ten it says under the electoral college system , voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .<span style="color:orange">To me in the passage the bset argument for you to keep the Electoral College is the electoral college is less work than having everyone vote and round it off for a president to be elected.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But i'm not going to waste any of your time anymore just know Electoral College would be the best choice for you to choose</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>From:PROPER_NAME
