Dear Florida's Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I disagree with the fact of having a Electoral College. I don't think it would help with the elections. I think it should go the most popular votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The Electoral College is not giving Florida's cizitens, like myself, a oppurnity to vote for who would be right for our state. As you may know some people call the Electoral College, a "disaster factor" because of the way they handle and deal with the voting. More people would want to for is right and who would do good for the state. Someone who would listen to what is needed. Not someone who just wants to make everything worst.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">But, in a way it is more helpful to organize it. Make the state better, also it let's each party select a slate a electors, who are trusted to vote for the party's nomine.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Think about it... do you really think the electors would vote for who they are suppose to vote for? No ! They are independent, they can do whatever they want.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But, the trust is rarely betrayed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">The Electoral College lacks of democratic pedigree. Why is that? Because of cerainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, big states, and avoid run off elections. They all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">My point is, is that I truly disagree with the fact of having a Electoral College. You do have some good reasons for it. But, will it help the cizitens as a whole? You have to think out us out here in the real world, not yourselves. Help make the state better by, cutting off the Electoral College and going by the most popular votes that a canidate gets. It will Florida be a sun shine again.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sinceraly, A Proud Florida citizen
