Dear senator of Florida,</br></br>I<span style="color:orange">n my opinion of the Electoral College, I think we should keep it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.064997074,<span style="color:white">0.8815125079999999</span>,0.0534904186]</span>  <span style="color:white">Many people would most likely say I am wrong to think that way or I am just a kid and I have no idea what I am discussing</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.3287511879999999</span>,0.653119776,0.0181290506]</span> , <span style="color:orange">but I really think we should even though it has some flaws, here is my three reasons why.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.150752476,<span style="color:white">0.825412762</span>,0.023834756]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">First, it was established by our founding fathers</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0760676919999999,<span style="color:white">0.865411956</span>,0.0585203889999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The ones who fought in battle against Britan. They sacerficed their lives to get us where we are today. Its not just a law, its what connects us to our ancestors and its what makes us unique from most nations voting systems today and back then.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.306636522,<span style="color:white">0.673393062</span>,0.0199704216]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Second, Though most will complain that we are not actually voting for president, but that we are putting our time and effort into voting for a slate of electors who then vote for president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.078352893,<span style="color:white">0.83242325</span>,0.0892238467999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Even though there is no rule against them not voting for the president of your choosing, most of them will vote for him since they are on his team and have pleged themselves to him. So really there is a very high chance of them voting for the president you want. I say they have done a very good job for such a stressing carrier.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.319300934,<span style="color:white">0.65971428</span>,0.0209847606]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Third, It has been going good so far.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.2218048749999999,<span style="color:white">0.750518982</span>,0.0276761382]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There are'nt wars taking place outside our homes like in some countries. Our Republican and Democratic parties are gracious in victory or humble in defeat. Yes there are some flaws in the system but thats just human nature. None of us are perfect and we never will be. We will make mistakes and we just got to live with them because there going to happen whether we like it or not.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.47700505,<span style="color:white">0.508211626</span>,0.0147833326999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This is my three major reasons why I think we should keep the Electoral College.
