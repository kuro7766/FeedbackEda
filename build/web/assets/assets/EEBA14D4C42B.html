In the image, there was a piece of land which appeared to look much like a human face. Once NASA reveiled the shocking news, Many people did not believe them. Humans thought that aliens were the ones who contrusted such a thing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">NASA has more than enough facts and evidence to prove that it was made naturally.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The article says "Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars." This means that the landform was made by natural occurances. The landform is natural. The passage also says "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reavealing... a natural landform. This means that there was no alien monument after all." There is much more proof of this landform being natural than there is being made by aliens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Others say, that aliens made this formation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The article states that "Conspiracy theorists say that the Face is evidence that NASA would rather hide."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The thing that they do not realize is the fact that they have no proof of NASA "making up" a story like this.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Theorists have not studied the landform as much as we have. How can people think that the Face is created by aliens when theres absolutely no proof of their existance?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Making up fake stories for publicity is extremely wrong. If theres no evidence of something being fake, than just belive that it is real.
