<span style="color:orange">While humanity is doing just fine with how we use cars now,driverless cars are apart of our not too distant future. Personally,I'm neutral in this argument but if this new way of using our vehicles advances our humanity I'm all for it. People these days are reckless when it comes to driving and so maybe a car that does the driving will in a way stop all the accidents and reckless driving.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0333784262,<span style="color:white">0.697059436</span>,0.269562166]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Driverless cars could reduce hit and runs</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0640308018,<span style="color:white">0.853519228</span>,0.082449997]</span>  but <span style="color:orange">drivers are still needed in certain situations.

Sensors are needed for these unique cars because they advance the car to mimic the skill of humans at the wheel and respond to the danger or something out of control. These sensors give the car info or a warning to cause the car to apply brakes and reduce power from the engine. The sensors give the special car better responses and more control than a human driver could manage alone.</br></br><span style="color:orange">These advanced cars are amazing but are exspensive and a bit of a risk. None of the cars are completely driverless. These cars can steer,accelerate,and brake,but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. So like navigating through work zones or around accidents. The driver must stay alert and ready to take over when the time comes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.111752264,<span style="color:white">0.8237300359999999</span>,0.064517694]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This is what I mean when I say what's the point of driverless cars if we're still basically driving the car.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.146259784,<span style="color:white">0.8068242620000001</span>,0.0469159794]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I do like how Gm has developed the driver's seat to vibrate when the car is in danger of backing into an object because of my personal experience with backing my first car into a fire hydrent.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.0879005296,<span style="color:white">0.8332659719999999</span>,0.078833504]</span> </br></br>To conclude,<span style="color:orange">Manufacturers are considering adding cameras to most of the cars so the drivers are remaining focused ont eh road.
