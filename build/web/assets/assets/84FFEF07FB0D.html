The article states that the picture of the Face is " the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West." More information about the "Face on Mars" is in the following statements.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It has been scientifically proven that the Face is nothing more than a rocky landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Although it may seem to be formed my aliens, the Face truly is just a natural rock formation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There is no actual evidence of life on other planets. Why assume that just by a mesa? The Face is made up of shadows. You too can probably make shadows that look like something it is not.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">NASA has taken photos at different pixel sizes.
