It consist of the selection of the electors and then the electors vote for the President and Vice President.

This article they give you five reasons to keep our method of choosing the president. That one that was best for me was that " Everyones's president" just beacuse  at the end of the day what's important is choosing the right president for the job that the reason this method was created. I read the part where it say even if we do let the people vote , some people will end up feeling like their votes don't count simply cause they live in a small town with a very low population. Exsactly how it says in the article "...a large state gets more attencion from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.110150377,<span style="color:white">0.716831926</span>,0.173017705]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">To conclude the Electoral College method is the best way to make sure all the people are getting the president the diserve. As i said in the bigging is a good neat process that is well put together and that will help mamy people out. Voting by population  vote is not safe and it's not for sure , you may think that if you vote for a president that he will win but your wrong there is a better change of him winning if the electors vote for him then you. I hope that when you are done reading this you will understand why the Electoral College should come back and it should stay.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0461593999999999,<span style="color:white">0.7101164680000001</span>,0.2437241399999999]</span>
