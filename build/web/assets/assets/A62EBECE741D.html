All students should at lest do one activity rather than academics. This decision should be allowed if a student wants to do a activity or not.

Some students would rather sit and work with the yearbook. Some just want to help other people in the school. All academics should be for one half of school time and activity the second half. The activities would help students refresh their brains and forget the things they are going through.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>  What activity would you like to do?
