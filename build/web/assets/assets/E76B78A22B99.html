<span style="color:orange">I am a scientist at NASA my name is Jeff. There is a face on mars and people think its by aliens well I know its not by aliens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It is just a natural landform on mars its nothing big it wasnt made by aliens</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">and a lot of people think its by aliens and then a lot of people agree with me also.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This face on mars is a natural landform anything can happen on a planet that we have'nt been on yet</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> <span style="color:white">. We do not know what this planet is capble of and whats on the planet of mars. Well I think that it wasnt made by aliens becuase it gets more noticable by the years pass then it dissappers in a different year. Well Im sure our planet looks different from space in different years.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Why would aliens even want to put a face on the planet. Im sure if there was aliens on mars they would'nt be carving a face on there own planet</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:white">Im sure there living there life on mars not knowing we even exsit thats if there is aliens on there. They wouldnt what anything with us if they did I think they would have made more signs then just two dots and a straight line and they would have made the face more noticable and it dissapears after a couple of years that is probbaly of there is wind or something that might have blew away they face</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> <span style="color:orange">. We had our best people look into it and they think its a landform to they got pictures and eveidence that its just a regular landform!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>
