Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I feel that students should have to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.01119343586,<span style="color:white">0.344307542</span>,0.6444990199999999]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Not only does community service help others but,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00933378566,0.262308508,<span style="color:white">0.7283576979999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">it also teaches good skills that students may use later in life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00573845198,0.2154414708,<span style="color:white">0.7788200399999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Community service also teaches students to look at the greater picture. That the world doesn't always revolve around them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00540873372,0.1935182999999999,<span style="color:white">0.801073018</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Instead of sitting at home all weekend and playing Wii, students should go out and help their community in various ways.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0041133237399999,0.169943862,<span style="color:white">0.8259428099999999</span>]</span> </br></br>Even if some students say that they have other obligations in their life outside of school they should still be able to set aside a small amount of time for doing community service. <span style="color:yellow">For example, picking up trash in a local park will help reduce the amount of pollution. Or collecting canned goods would help feed the homeless.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01535189146,0.2780559079999999,<span style="color:white">0.706592178</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Think about if every school required students do community service. That would be a lot of schools helping our country and our Earth. The community service does not have to be hard, it can be age appropriate</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0360148064799999,<span style="color:white">0.3690777019999999</span>,0.594907494]</span> . Taking part in community service will teach students skills such as leadership and honesty. <span style="color:yellow">If our generation starts cleaning up this world and making it a better place, I'm sure that we can teach generations after us to follow in our footsteps.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0738046782,0.435003516,<span style="color:white">0.491191834</span>]</span> </br></br>In conclusion <span style="color:orange">I feel that students should have to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.01119343586,<span style="color:white">0.344307542</span>,0.6444990199999999]</span> </br></br>What they "need" or want to do probably isn't as important as giving back to the community. The community service does not have to conflict with the students life outside of school; it can be as short as one or two hours. Which is why students have no reason why they shouldn't help.
