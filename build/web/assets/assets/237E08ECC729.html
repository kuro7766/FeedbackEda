<span style="color:yellow">How does the Electoral College affect the selection of the presidency and is it a positive force? Many may answer "No." or "I don't know." to these questions, only doing such because that's what they've been or what they've heard others say.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.01454396154,0.2031080819999999,<span style="color:white">0.782347934</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">While many have negative feelings, or no feelings at all, towards the Electoral College, it is a very useful force in electing the President because of its</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.00648369602,0.204116214,<span style="color:white">0.7894001199999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">certainty</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0115172406,0.267410732,<span style="color:white">0.72107208</span>]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">its transregionality,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.01036690076,0.262956882,<span style="color:white">0.726676232</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">and it lets "the most thoughtful voters" (Posner Source 3) decide the election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0057577769,0.1955491519999999,<span style="color:white">0.7986930560000001</span>]</span> </br></br>Swings states let candidates to campaign where it really matters. Being a voter in a swing state means you have to have extra close attention to the campaigns and the candidates, leaving you to be more thoughtful than voters in states that aren't swing states. <span style="color:yellow">And in turn voters in these states will definitely receive "the most information and attention from the candidates" (Posner Source 2). Voters from these states at the end of the campaigns will no doubt be the most informed voters in the nation, giving them the right to decide the fate of the election for the future.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00566276,0.1455717799999999,<span style="color:white">0.848765478</span>]</span> </br></br>A successful president must be voted for across the regions of the United States to fufill the wants and needs of its diverse people. <span style="color:yellow">While popular voting can be skewed naturally to one region or another due to their preferences and populations, the Electoral College ensures that one region can't win a campaign alone. If the President was to win due to popular vote and only because of regional appeal, "residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised..." (Posner Source 3) and that their president will not best represent everyone's interests.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00320738898,0.098931204,<span style="color:white">0.8978613880000001</span>]</span> </br></br>The use of the Electoral College allows for a more certain winner over popular vote, therefore avoiding election crisis. <span style="color:yellow">Although there was one "fiasco" in 2000, as Bradford Plumer calls it in Source 2,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.0107182245399999,0.250347108,<span style="color:white">0.738934668</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">the chance of this happening is very small since "even a very slight pulrality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state."
