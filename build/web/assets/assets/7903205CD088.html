Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that having cell phones at lunch periods and at other free times such as locker break would be better in ways</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">students could communicate with other class mates with work needed to be done and needs help reviewing,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  but <span style="color:orange">having cell phones at school could tempt other students to text or call their parents to pick them up for early dismissal or a feign sickness.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Having cell phones at school would be crucial to school functioning</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">students would abuse the rule and do unneeded things at school such as "sexting" sending hurtful messages through other people to start a rumor.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Some people might get in fights and grades would probably decrease</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because people would be obsessed with texting.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">In a worst case scenario the school could get sued by a student getting a white slip, detention, ISS, suspended, or expelled and disagree about doing the wrong thing they did or if they where given it through "hard feelings" between a teacher and a student.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>So I agree somewhat with Policy 2, <span style="color:orange">I think students should be aloud to have cell phones at school but not be able to use them during school hours and have them off or have the home room teacher take them up each day and hold them until the end of school or dismissal.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
