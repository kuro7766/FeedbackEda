Dear state senator,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I think we should end the Electoral college because it is not fair to each american.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">It's not fair because voters can't control who they pick, and the person they vote for end up losing the presidential election</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Even though our founding fathers established this act it doesn't mean it benefits our country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electors are chosen by the candidate's democratic or republican's party. Some states has a "winner-take-all" process. When that process is over and the candidate win the presidential vote in that state, it then shows which electors will represent your state.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Although this would seem like a good way to vote</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I disagree.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  It is unfair to everyone.</br></br><span style="color:orange">It would be a lot easier for every citizen to just make their own personal vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>   <span style="color:orange">For an example, back in 2000 Al Gore had way more popular voters than George W. Bush who had a higher number of voters due to the Electoral College process.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think every state should reconsider picking the electors because they always seem to defy us.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Losing the Electoral College can also avoid any mishap in the future.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">What if there was a state that had equal number of votes? what would happen then</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> ?</br></br><span style="color:orange">It has been stated that over 60 percent of citizens would rather vote towards their candidate they select, rather than going through the process</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">congress should consider the thoughts and opinions that us voters have. If they wish to not do so the candidate with the popular votes could potentially lose presidency.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion to the eyes of the government it may seem like a proper way to vote, but to us it's unfair. You should abolish the Electoral College for good so we can elect the right candidate who deserves presidency. In order to get rid of this process we should take a single vote from every citizens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
