This system disregards that the opposing candidate received any votes, because all the electors are given to the winner. This doesn't give a chance to the candidates whose party is not necessarily popular in that state. Candidates, therefore spend more time and money campaigning in states they know their party is popular in. According to Bradfor Plumer in 2000, 25 of the largest media markets did not see a campaign ad, because they lived in one of the seventeen states that had no campaigning. Some candiates don't even campaign in some states based on this.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00279906922,0.0779361554,<span style="color:white">0.919264758</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">According to an excerpt from</br></br>Mother Jones by Bradford Plumer most candidates focus on the "swing" states where it is close competiton.  In the case of tie in the electoral vote, the house of reprensentatives vote. This means one  vote represents the whole state.

According to Bradford Palmer in 1960 there was a problemwith the Louisiana legistlature choosing bias electors. Segregationists wanted to be rid the democratic electors and replace them with electors who would not vote for John F. Kennedy. In another case, there has been a history of electors voting for whom they want instead of their party's vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00910359208,0.1803965,<span style="color:white">0.810499916</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Voters often are not update onall the campaigns due to the unfairness of the electoral vote.

The voters know about the presidential candidate not the elector. States often do not get the same level of campaigning as eachother. According to</br></br>Slate Magazine a larger state gets more attention from the presidential candidates than a smaller state does. Over 60 percent of citizens who vote would like a direct election instead of the kind we have now, says Bradford Palmer.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00711023692,0.194030884,<span style="color:white">0.7988588539999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college has caused enough confusion in its lifetime.
