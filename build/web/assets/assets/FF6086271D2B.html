The Electoral College is less susceptible to problems if the poular votes are used to elect the college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00659800104,0.215106747,<span style="color:white">0.7782952559999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In</br></br>Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a president, in the first reason it says that, "...The winning canidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceed's his share of the popular vote."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.029374766,<span style="color:white">0.459140406</span>,0.51148481]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Secondly, Having an Electoral College avoids run-off elections, where the problem is cause by each canidate that is running to not get any of the majority of the votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.01145045596,0.278624888,<span style="color:white">0.7099246539999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">To put it in more simple terms, In some cases there have been ties by the popular vote, or very close ties. In The same article as mentioned in the above paragraph provided the example of one time that this has happened. " Nixon and Clinton both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College." The Electoral Colege breaks the tie in the poular votes because they reduce the pressure of having run-off elections. The states have a "winner-take-all" system, so that when the elections come, the president of those who are voting for him in the electoral college get to be with that president. The larger states recieve more attention from the canidates, so the popular vote getting tied up also does not happen very often.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.008543139,0.1439044304,<span style="color:white">0.8475524100000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Last but not least, it is incredibly important to know how the Electoral College works because if you do not, then you will not know how effective of a sytem it is.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0172489528999999,0.32808971,<span style="color:white">0.6546613320000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">In</br></br>What is the Electoral College?</br></br>it states that, "The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president." The popular vote can get tied up pretty easily, but it is a lot harder for the electoral votes to get tied up because only 270 votes are needed to elect the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0468639524,0.411148464,<span style="color:white">0.5419876029999999</span>]</span>  The popuar vote actually elects the College. <span style="color:orange">"...But each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee.." and this quote was selected from</br></br>I defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president .
