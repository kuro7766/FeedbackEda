Having fellow citizens <span style="color:orange">limiting car usage can have many advantages</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> .

France even tried to ban cars even and odd to reduce the pollution as being talked about in paragraph 2 and 3. They were being fined if they drove, that is atleast until the air cleared up.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">On the other hand, banning cars or not driving is a silly decision. It may be good for our earth and our health, but if you need to leave three hours before hand to reach your destination on time, then you need to buckle up and step on the gas. If gas so so bad for the enviornment, then why dont we ban gas cars?</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">There are many indrustries and or companys that have created electronic cars.

Cars can clean up the air but also make us gasp for it. Having a car should be a choice we get to make. Having events and days where "no cars can be driven or you get a fine" is not needed in anybodys lives. What decision would you decide, having a car, or joining in on being green?       Â
