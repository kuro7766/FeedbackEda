Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Policy 1 I believe is better because as long as the students turn the cell phones off during class time it would be fine.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The students should be able to use their cell phones at lunch or in their free time so that they can call parents if they need to ask them something like whether to ride the bus or take a car.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also policy 1 would be better because the student would be more likely to pay attention in class if they were able to use the cell phones at lunch.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think the kids would be very thankful for Policy 1 instead of Policy 2</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because they love cell phones, and problem dislike school which would make them enjoy school as much as cell phones. You could even give the kids websites to go to and do work in class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Parents would even like it better because they could get a hold of their children if they needed to instead of having to wait till after school</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">It would also be better because the kid can talk their friends on the other side of the building.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>
