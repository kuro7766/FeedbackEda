That shows that NASA doesn't want to say to anybody that is assuming that this is created by aliens because they really want this to be confidential. People thing the face is evidence of life on Mars and the Face is bona fide so they are saying there has to be life on Mars. In reality they don't know what they are saying so they are assuming that this was created by aliens just to start talk and give people something to talk about. This is evidence of why you can't believe anything without true evidence.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.311893412,<span style="color:white">0.673027726</span>,0.01507886036]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">NASA won't even leak anything</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.2001058399999999</span>,0.7921367619999999,0.00775741832]</span> . Some people think that Face is bona fide and that shows there are aliens on Mars. Nobody knows is that is true because if you read the paragraph it says some people think and everyone is believing what people think. <span style="color:white">THe story has been around for about the Face on Mars and it's bween everywhere for about 25 years and after a while of the story people started to say things that are not real mixed in with real things and people have just been going around like that.
