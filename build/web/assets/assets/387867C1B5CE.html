<span style="color:orange">People are saying there's a face on mars. This is true, people are also questioning if aliens had put it there, it may just be a historical formation on the earth, reasearches believe it may just be a formation and not created by aliens. People have named this formation the "Face on Mars" it has become to be a very popular sight that people are wanting to see more and more of it. This is so popular that it has been in "Hollywood films, appearded in books, magizines, and even talk shows."</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.112540177,<span style="color:white">0.8443457619999999</span>,0.043114049]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Researchers found this figure on the planet mars, they found this not only weird but very interseting. They thought lets do more research to find out what actually caused this formation on mars. Reasearchers thought at first that aliens had put this figure on the planet because it is a figure of a human face. They took big cameras up into mars and sized the figure so large so they could get closer pictures of the image.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.194847736</span>,0.792868326,0.0122839398399999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The more research the reasearchers did the more facts they found. They had many sightings like this before and they figured maybe a alien did not put that figure on mars. Reasearchers may have thought this because there had been many different formations on earths surface, it was most likely caused by earths erosion or natural features.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.104577125,<span style="color:white">0.8773403999999999</span>,0.0180824969]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They compare some ideas to it just like the "Middle Butte in the snake river of Idaho."

They say this because they went back up and looked some more around the area where the face was found to see if there was a "alien monument." Come to find out there was no alien monument around or even located on mars so aliens did not cause this</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.128667984</span>,0.8517862299999999,0.0195457932]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Researchers believe that this was just a normal formation from the planet mars that just occured, but did people?</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.093886842,<span style="color:white">0.8899863120000001</span>,0.0161268168]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">When this all came to take place the first day they let the news out it went viral.

Also have patience to see what really happened to the item that was found. You might just be amazed for once.
