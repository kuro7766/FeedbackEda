<span style="color:white">The idea of these "Driveless Cars" does sound intersting and at the most fascinating. But however i'm going to say i'm all that for that particular idea for a few reasons</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span> . And to start off <span style="color:orange">I don't see how it would be called "Driveless Cars" if there is still human assitance requried</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  . <span style="color:orange">To me this isn't all the way driveless driving its more like the car assistaing you most of the time. And this could also cause problems betweem the drivers and the companys responible for these cars .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The way I may see it is why spend thousands of dollars creating something the requries human skills you might as well not even make it</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  . And with <span style="color:orange">this creation is something not everyone can afford</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  . <span style="color:orange">If one driver has this creation but the may not this would most likely lead the driveless car driver to accidently hit the car or drive that has a driveless car there are also still chances of acidents</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So if not everyone can afford a driveless car why even bring it out for people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>And the fact that <span style="color:orange">manufactures want to use camera to watch the driver can be uncomfortable to the drivers.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  And by also <span style="color:orange">having to change laws here and there if this vehical is realsed nto everyone may follow or agree with them</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  .<span style="color:orange">There's people now that can't even follow the simple rules of driving.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>And <span style="color:orange">this could also lack people's precaution or alterness in any type of car or anywhere else</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . And <span style="color:orange">if its times for the driver to do his or hers part what if they are on there cellphone like most days now and when they are alterted they look up and its to late. Its relly important that a person is alert at all times and take their own responibility.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">While the details and positive benefits these "Driveless Cars" may sound great but the neagatives can also affect people. And the negatives can also put someone in the chance of danger .</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>
