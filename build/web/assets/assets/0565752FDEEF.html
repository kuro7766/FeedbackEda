The author states "the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better responce and control than a human driver could manage alone." This would allow cars to stop faster than humans could manage and to prevent cars from scidding and flipping. The author reffers to the advancements in the sensors that "make driving safer" would allow cars that can handle more tasks on their own.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Cars that <span style="color:yellow">accelerate</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  on their own would prevent speeding, which is a risky driving habit.
