Second can make the students upset, by making the student do more work then they need. Third it can drive the students insane, by making the students do way too much school work.

Second it can stop the student focus dead in it's tracks, just because there is a little too much work for the student to keep going and work. Third</br></br>It will also slow down the student work rate and make them feel like they need to study more which then will put the student in a very bad mental place. Those were also some reasons why, you should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0336439522,0.4459847099999999,<span style="color:white">0.520371336</span>]</span> </br></br>Here are the final reasons why, you should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year. <span style="color:orange">Taking a extracurricular activity can overload some students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.01713409706,<span style="color:white">0.48314326</span>,0.49972266]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">First it can make the student do too much work, because some students are going for a advanced diploma and if they had to do a extracurricular activity that would pile on top of the student making him or her do too much work. Second some student might have other activities to do out side of school so that would just stop them from doing what they enjoy after school. Third it may also make students miss out on certain events that happen every couple of years, like for say you wanted to go to a concert that a band was doing and that was there last concert that they will ever do, you would really want to go, but as long as you have a extracurricular activity you might not be able to go and watch the performance in person. Those were the final reasons why should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.02743437286,0.344316294,<span style="color:white">0.6282493379999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Those are a few reason why, you should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year. Another reason is because it can cause stress by making the student focus on two things at once therefore bring the students grades down and make the student worried about if he or she will pass the year. Another reason is it can create a loss in productivity by slowing down the work rate of the student making them feel dumb or behind in class. The final reason to wrap it up is that it can overload a student by giving them too much work permanently putting themselves in a bad mental state at school just because of a little too much work. Those were all the reasons why you should not need a extracurricular activity to pass the school year.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.01502023002,0.380936728,<span style="color:white">0.604043048</span>]</span>
