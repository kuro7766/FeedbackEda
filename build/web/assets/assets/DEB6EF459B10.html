Dear principle,</br></br><span style="color:white">It would be fare to other kids if you put " you cant play any sports unless you have a B average or more"</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">so many kids probably couldn't play their favorite sports and their parents would get mad enough to have them switch schools</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . lets put it this way, if you <span style="color:white">say they can have a C average in their grade the school would be a lot better place and wouldn't be as boring as it is.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">you could have a really good athlete who does every sport and is a super good running back for the team, real fast and every thing. what happens if he dropped from a</br></br>B average to a C average? that's what i am talking about. you can just at least say you have 2 weeks to get up your grades and if you don't then to bad so sad. if you're school is having a big dodge ball tournament after school and you have teams you play with and you have a C average then its really boring for you and your dodge ball team is one man short and they cant play because of you.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">all the student would want to change that other than the really smart students who have A averages, but that isn't the case here. its just wouldn't be fair to all the other student who liked sports in that school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>  so can we just see how it goes.</br></br>sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
