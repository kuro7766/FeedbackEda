As policy 1 requires only use cell phones during lunch and free time that means the teacher is not teaching class when we have our cells phone out. And if a phone does go off in class take that students phone away not everyone's. That's just the first reason why policy 1 is the best.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1425724548,<span style="color:white">0.846531576</span>,0.0108959708]</span> </br></br>Next this brings me to is <span style="color:orange">emergencies</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1407117932,<span style="color:white">0.852756802</span>,0.00653140216]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I feel that if 20 students in a class has a phone and a intruder comes at least half the students can call 911. Also if a student is sick just tell the teacher to use bathroom where the student can call him/her parent , instead of having to fill out a slip to the nurse and its not disrupting class. Now TEACHER_NAME</br></br>that sounds good.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1490829872,<span style="color:white">0.838144102</span>,0.0127728871]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The last reason policy 1 is good is because we need to have fun</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1485802976,<span style="color:white">0.844289654</span>,0.00713007096]</span> . <span style="color:orange">All we do is work all day and never have a break unless you have physical education. Also students will be way more happier and would want to go to school to learn instead of being bored half to death.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1920562712,<span style="color:white">0.8018889120000001</span>,0.00605481518]</span> </br></br>So that's the last reason why policy 1 is the best.</br></br>Now that you have read this I will like you to think about policy 1 and how different school will be. From not disrupting class, <span style="color:orange">emergencies</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1407117932,<span style="color:white">0.852756802</span>,0.00653140216]</span> , and letting us have some fun. Now you think about how school will be after that.
