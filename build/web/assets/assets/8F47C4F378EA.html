<span style="color:orange">I am a high school student and in my point of view what i infer about reading the passage is that election by popular votes needs to happen</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . why am I thinking like this? <span style="color:white">There are several reasons, well first i dont know what this people are doing maybe they are being paid to choose the president it dosen't mean enything that they got more ethoes than the rest of the state</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">People should choose who they really want to be the president, they should give prove of when they count the votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The countrie is the home of alot of people imigrants and native we all should have the same rigths and that rigth is to vote for the person that will lead the countrie to a better place, not some slate of the state. Maybe they got more ethoes than the rest of the countrie but each person is smart to know what is good and what is wrong. In the passage they tell the reader, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Then what is the point of voting maybe this people are not even considering the people who vote they are only doing what they think is rigth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This people have alot of money but they still want more and more, inportant people would brive this elector with alot of money, and they would be doing whatever they are ask for.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They could be 200 votes of the entire state that if the state only as 20 electors thoes are the votes that are counting in real life. What future could we have trusting this electors our chances are really low we cant let this happen</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  .</br></br><span style="color:orange">After reading all my letter you will understeand why did I talke like this about the elector and why  the electoral college have to be remove. The word of the entire countrie should coun't more than the wor of 200 people. Thoes 200 could be in who knows what to trust our future. this is why I think that electoral college is not an opssion.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
