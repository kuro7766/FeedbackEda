Dear State Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I would like it if you would just keep the Electoral college because it would be so much easier to pick a president then if we the people had to pick the president</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0789149524,<span style="color:white">0.877140146</span>,0.0439449228]</span> . <span style="color:white">If we screw up and pick the wrong president then its our fault, but if you all pick the president it'll be your fault if the president turns out to be good or not. Besides the founding fathers founded the Electoral college so we should keep it just for their sake. Anyway the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors which then when there picked they decide who is the new or repeating President of the United States of America. The reasons I would like to see the Electoral college do good is because the first reason as to why you should just keep the Electoral college is because everyone will want to be president heres an example .The Electoral college requires a presidential canidate to have transregional appeal. If you have a solid regional favorite you go for them states first then you work around to different states to get more Electoral votes but then if you leave that state that was with you all the way then they atomatically switch to the other person that has been campaigning around all the other states and takes your states what are you supposed to do then? The only thing you can do is just go back and try to get your state back..</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.866747242</span>,0.1288784684,0.00437427862]</span> </br></br>Sincerly,</br></br>PROPER_NAME
