<span style="color:orange">In 1976 something very strange was found by the Viking 1 spacecraft. It appeared to be a face on the surface of the planet Mars. With this discovery NASA scientists took further investigations into what this picture could actually be. The scientists looked at the picture and determined that it was not a face only a mesa that looked like a face because shadows were casted onto it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">NASA realeased this picture to the public saying that this was not a face on Mars only a mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">This attracted the publics attention and it became a huge pop icon that appeared in books,magazinse,radio talk shows,and even in grocery store isles for Twenty-Five years.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Many conspiracy theorists thought that this could actually be evidence of life on Mars</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> ,<span style="color:orange">But if this was true why would NASA not realease it to get a huge government grant to try and develope a way to send people to Mars to explore.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">On April 5,1998 Eightteen years after the Viking 1 and 2 were shut down the Mars Orbiter Camera came into orbit range of Mars and started taking pictures. The team of scientists espiecially focused on getting a picture of the face so they could reveal to public that there was indeed no face on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The picture came back alot more clear and showed that there was no face on Mars therefore stating that there was no ancient civilization that NASA was hiding.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">On April 8,2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take another picture of the face,And this time the scientists angled it perfectly so they had the best possible picture to stop all the non-sense about the face on Mars. They took the picture and enhanced it three times the size.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This picture was released to public and it showed that the "Face" was actually a martian equivalent of a mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion there was no actually face on Mars,And the entire time it was only a landform which there are very many of on the entire planet of Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>
