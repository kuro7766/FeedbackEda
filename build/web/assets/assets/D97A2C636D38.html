Bradford Plumers The Indefsible Electoral Collage he says "At the most basic level, the electoral collage is unfair to voters, because of the winner take all system in each state" he then says " The candidates only spend time in the swing states where they know they have a chance of winning"; he is pointing out that those who are running for president spend a mojortity of their time in the states where they can get the most amount of votes for example they might campain to Florida or Washington DC but not even go to a state like Wyoming or Idoh.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0513371952,<span style="color:white">0.595833706</span>,0.352829096]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think we should have the popular vote because it goves everyone a chance to vote for the president, they can voice their opions out loud and have a chance at seeing who they want in office.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0228842374,<span style="color:white">0.593852376</span>,0.3832634]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Another reason the Electoral Collage is unfair is because the electors might all be Republican or all Democrat but we as voters dont get a chance to pick what party we stand for, with popular vote you have a chance to say who you want and what party you represent weather its Republican, Democrat or Induvial you at least get the chance and even though its only a 25 percent  chance who you vote for is going to win at least its still a chance.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.083457922,<span style="color:white">0.729595628</span>,0.1869464556]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Popular vote has its many advantges but one of the best is you can "get to know" who your voting for the canidates can come to your state and make speechs, have posters something to tell you what they are planning on doing if they get elected, this gives every state a fair chance to see who they are voting for.
