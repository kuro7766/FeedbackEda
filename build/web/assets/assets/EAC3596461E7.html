Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:white">Out of the two possible policies you are considering I would have to say that i favor the second</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1861628679999999</span>,0.78143862,0.0323985169999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The idea of allowing students to use cell phones during free time makes absolute sense</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0387445488,<span style="color:white">0.838673118</span>,0.1225823304]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Not allowing the phones during class time is respectable as well, that way the learning isn't affected.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.056301424,<span style="color:white">0.791365834</span>,0.1523327427999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">During free time, students aren't putting their time into anything anyway. Letting them use their phones will have no affect what so ever or anything important, such as school work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0446927873999999,<span style="color:white">0.751106462</span>,0.2042007364]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There is really no downside to policy number one. It will make most students very pleased as well.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.264827155,<span style="color:white">0.7172864299999999</span>,0.01788637956]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Policy two however, I am against. The idea of no phones what so ever seems harsh and strict.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1126162332,<span style="color:white">0.80188462</span>,0.0854991374]</span>  <span style="color:orange">What is the student is having a bad day and can't call a parents for a little help? That could affect how the learn in school, not being able to have outside connections. It would be like the student was in a cage for an entire school day, how would you feel to be locked up in a cage? The student's should be allowed their freedom.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.083546435,<span style="color:white">0.76344484</span>,0.1530087078]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There is always a punishment for not following the rules, some will have to be thought of, of course, if the new policy that you choose is not followed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1562426551999999,<span style="color:white">0.74910776</span>,0.0946495996]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Don't expect everything to run smooth at first, things may always be changed. Try out letting students use the phones during free time, it's just something new. It may lead to a happier environment, and maybe even better grades for students. Young people love freedom and being allowed to do what they want, giving them this freedom could have a tremendous outcome.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.193130146,<span style="color:white">0.7552894200000001</span>,0.0515804261999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I am sure that you have many other things to think about, so, with that I give you, thank you and goodbye.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.522388066,<span style="color:white">0.4694286639999999</span>,0.0081832298]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>A student with a voice.
