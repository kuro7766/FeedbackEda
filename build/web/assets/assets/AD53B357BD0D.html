Not only are people getting different ideas of what they may want to do, they can also get advise from people who may be more experienced than themselves. For example, if someone was debating on which college they should apply to, they may end up asking people such as older siblings or parents for advise because they may have more experience with that matter. By asking multiple people, you can get multiple ideas, each of them being different in their own way. By getting more people's input, you may be able to start to make your own choice about the matter because of the advise you've gotten.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000829119642,0.0596677656,<span style="color:white">0.939503118</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Another way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by not getting any biased opinions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0014856347999999,0.145950704,<span style="color:white">0.8525636599999998</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">By asking more than one person for advise on a subject, they can get more than one new idea that isn't one of their own. This way, they can get more than one person's thoughts on the decision, and have different ideas on it. For example, if someone were trying to make a decision on what sport they may want to tryout for at school, they could possibly ask their friends and family about which they should choose. However, they should also ask people like classmates and teachers, as they may have their own ideas, and won't give the person any biased ideas or information. Friends and family can have a great deal of influence on people, so it's important to always get people's thoughts that are on the outside. This will make it to where there's a greater chance of the decision maker not being biased, as they've heard numerous people's thoughts, and can make their own decision off of that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000443919348,0.0311526554,<span style="color:white">0.968403448</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">A final way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by being more prepared about the choice they're going to make.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00182649584,0.154592936,<span style="color:white">0.843580562</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The decision maker can use all the advise they've gotten from different people to make their own choice, and feel better prepared. They will be more focused as they know what they want to do, and will feel more confident and less overwhelmed. Feeling less overwhelmed can be a big help as the person doesn't have to be so worried, so they won't have any distractions from making the best possible decision. For example, if someone is trying to decide what kind of car they want to get, and they've gotten advise from numerous people, they can make a better choice when picking. They'll know exactly what they want, as they've heard many thoughts from the people around them, and so they can make their final decision.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0009581907,0.0611872604,<span style="color:white">0.937854552</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">After getting advise from multiple people around them, the decision maker may be able to make the best choice possible, as they've gotten new thoughts and ideas. Asking for help or for some advise from those around you can help you make the best possible choice because you've gotten a lot of new information and opinions that you wouldn't have gotten if you had only asked one or no one at all for advise. Making an important choice can seem a little bit easier and less stressful after seeking advise from multiple people. Getting help from others around you can help you make the best choice you can.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0013098444399999,<span style="color:white">0.1175417366</span>,0.881148438]</span> Â
