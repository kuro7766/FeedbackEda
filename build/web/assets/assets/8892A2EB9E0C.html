<span style="color:orange">In 1976 a mars global surveyor image from 1998, and the latest MGS image from 2001. Twenty five years ago a "human face" was photographed on Mars. NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was trying to photograph possible landing area for the Viking 1 spacecraft's siter, Viking 2. When they were capturing photos they came across a face. Now you're saying that it was created by aliens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">If it was formed by aliens, Where did the aliens go?</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Where did they come from? How do you know for sure that aliens exist there has been no sightings of "Aliens". Nothing can live on Mars. If so why are they not still there.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It was a Martian mesa, common enough around Cyndonia,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">it only had ONE unusual shadow. No more than one unusual form. We had researchers, we also had all the right rescources to figure it was only a Martian mesa. Where is your evidence that it was aliens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It was just a landform that was formed on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">They only sent it out to attract attention to NASA. When it did it got way to out of control.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The article also said that "the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds"</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If a high tech camera can't see through clouds then how could "Aliens" see through it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The landform was equivalent of a butte or mesa, those are landforms common around the American West. If it wan't a common landform then maybe I would believe you.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It was not "aliens" sorry to dissapoint you. If you could please have more research next time, that would be great. Evidence is apart of what we do here at NASA.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
