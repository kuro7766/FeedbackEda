On Vauban's streets, it is almost a car-free area. The only vehicle on the streets is the tram that travels to downtown Freiburg and few streets on one edge on the community.

On Monday, drivers with a even-numbered license plate have to leave their cars at home or pay a 22-euro fine, which is ($31).
