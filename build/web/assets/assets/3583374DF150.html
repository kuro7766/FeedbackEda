<span style="color:orange">Electoral voting is a voting system that is trash. No one likes it, its not fair for the people to have somone else (The Electors) vote for them. How do we have freedom of speech if were not the one's who are voting? Electoral votes are not what we need if we the people what a good president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0894599792,<span style="color:white">0.79198539</span>,0.11855463]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The majority of the popular vote in the united states should determine who sits in the</br></br>White House</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.06076418,<span style="color:white">0.840002414</span>,0.099233411]</span>  .</br></br><span style="color:orange">Abolishing the Electoral College is the best thing the the United States could do.

Same thing with the popular vote system, u have to get two-thirds of the popular vote in order to be persident. It's alot better than to worry about who your elector is going to vote for, all they care about (sadly) is the money.
