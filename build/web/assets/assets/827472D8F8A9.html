<span style="color:orange">There are always peple saying that aliens are alive and maybe that there is going to be an alien invasion. In 1976, a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) found an image of a peron or as MGS says a "a Viking photo."</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I believe the image of the Viking is just a landform and it wasn't created by aliens. I will explain to you why i think it's a landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">I believe the image is a just a landform because scientists haven't discovered life yet on mars even though they have found water on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  In paragraph 2, the author states, <span style="color:orange">"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">common enough around Cydnia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah." I agree with this statement because if the Martian mesa was made again, that means that they will be around for a long time and it will never disappear.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The author also states that people think the image or the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">By the looks of the images, I could see that every year they have taken it, I can see that it's disappearing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In the introduction, it says, "New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is is: A mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> " <span style="color:white">If people want evidence of aliens or other creatures, they will have to do research on their spare time because scientists have a job to do and they will only do what they are ordered to do</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Just to be clear, when they took the photos of the Face on 1976,1998, and 2001, the technology wasn't as advanced as it is today but, if we take a photo of it today, I believe there will probably be another one of the landfoms</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">or probably we might see the Face but just slowly disappearing. These were some of my reasons to argue with to support my belief of the Face being a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, the image of the Face was just a myth and I will never say it was created by aliens. Aliens aren't even real, that hasn't benn confirmed or said. Not one scientist has said that they have seen a living creature on any planet walking or doing anything. These were just rumors and it can be said as a myth if people want. Based on these reasons, I believe the Face is just a natural landform on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
