People could argue that the effort of studying Venus is useless and ineffective. However, scientists have little to no knowledge of how the planets in our solar system were made. Scientists could have more knowledge of Venus if they found a way to study the planet.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0251287016,0.466771002,<span style="color:white">0.5081002800000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The author of the article is right about the exploration of Venus being a worthy pursuit.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0312352851999999,<span style="color:white">0.7019333560000001</span>,0.266831348]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The author of the article does mention how difficult it is to study Venus by bringing up the planet's harsh atmosphere in Paragraph 3</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.05856625,<span style="color:white">0.796733826</span>,0.144699934]</span> . <span style="color:white">Which further proves his point how valuable it is to study Venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.24762105</span>,0.729801886,0.02257703556]</span>  <span style="color:orange">He also points out that Venus may have been a lot like Earth a long time ago in Paragraph 4.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.109381736,<span style="color:white">0.7745548760000001</span>,0.1160633746]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This doesn't just further our understanding of Venus, but it may also give us more information about Earth as well.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.142267154,<span style="color:white">0.800192386</span>,0.0575404593999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In Paragraph 5, the author mentions NASA's plans on how to study Venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.147649724,<span style="color:white">0.760979078</span>,0.0913711898]</span>  <span style="color:orange">He does mention that those plans may have challenges fo their own in Paragraph 6.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.1042798606,<span style="color:white">0.797468106</span>,0.0982520643999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The author pushes to try those plans out in a realistic manner.
