Dear Principle,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I understand that some people in this world do not care about our community at all, but it is very important to at least try to change it</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Requiring students to do community service will make keep our community a clean and safe environment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Therefore, I believe that community service should be required for students at school not everyday, but at least maybe twice a week.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">By doing this, you and everyone else who participates in this should be rewarded, but at the same time take responsibility to keep on making this place better for everybody.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Some students may help with tutoring other students who needs help with schoolwork or something along the lines of that. Other people go around picking trash up of the ground and putting it where it belongs and trying their best to keep our environment clean.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Today, we still have people going around throwing trash on the grounds. I myself, have experienced people putting trash on the grounds and leaving it there. It hurts me because everyday I look at how much work people put into making schools, office buildings, restaurants, and etc.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I hope that you have learned a lot from this and go along with requiring students to do community service no matter what it is they are doing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
