<span style="color:orange">What if I said that there are computers that can identify students emotions during class, well if you thought that was fake its actually real! Recently we've made this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that allows computers to show human enotions and even things like paintings. For an example we used this on a famous painting everyone has a least seen once in their ifetime, which is the Mona Lisa. It shows that she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.196246178,<span style="color:white">0.7886860600000001</span>,0.0150677674]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Those are things that can be cool to find out but it can also can be really valuable in a classrom.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.19610623,<span style="color:white">0.799868562</span>,0.00402524684]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">For a classroom it can valuable like after lunch every student must use it before starting class to check how they're feeing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.146047049,<span style="color:white">0.846964058</span>,0.00698890962]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It will very useful if a student is sad or angry percent is high. It can give the teacher a reasoning to go up to the student and ask, why are you sad or why your angry.

It would be helpful if classrooms to get a hold of it as it could benefit the students. Most students are not always happy in school and this technology can be the one to help that not be a case. Teachers can now help the students get even more smartier then they already are. Whoever thought a computer can be the one to help take your students to the top!</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0792862116,<span style="color:white">0.899015788</span>,0.0216980006]</span>
