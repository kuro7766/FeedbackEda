The Electorlal College is pretty much what the government wants rather than what the people want which is why many citizens have problems with our current president, so if the people could just get a say in who they think should run the country they should. When we vote for a presidential candidate we are actually voting for a slate of electors and not for the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Some of the smaller states don't get to see any campaign ads like the larger states do so they are basically putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The Electoral College is hurting our county because we are not getting the accurate votes we think we're getting. Citizens are not going to want to vote anymore because of how unfair these campaigns are. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think a single vote may decide an election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective]</span>
