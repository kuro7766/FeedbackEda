<span style="color:orange">So, you have read the article Unmasking the Face on Mars, am i right? Well, I have some theories of my own</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.2004654548,<span style="color:white">0.785093316</span>,0.01444123632]</span> , and <span style="color:orange">I can assure you that Cydonia on mars, is not a face or anything extra-terrestrial.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0743180836,<span style="color:white">0.89392146</span>,0.0317604888]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">My first reason as to why Cydonia on mars isnt a face is, well have you ever looked at the moon? Ever notice that when the moon if full, you see a face? Scientists in the past have been to the moon on investigations. While they were there they have proven that the face on the moon was just a bunch of craters</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.099318914,<span style="color:white">0.8616303700000001</span>,0.0390507238]</span> . <span style="color:orange">It is most likely that the face on mars is just creaters, or a mesa too.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.081030608,<span style="color:white">0.887610202</span>,0.0313592142]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">My second reason is, things in outer space pictures are going to be a lot bigger than in reality.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.326236692</span>,0.6603187540000001,0.0134445739]</span>  <span style="color:white">Take the sun for an example, we see the sun ten times smaller than it really is.

Buttles and mesas are landforms common around the American west. "It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho" says Garvin. "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same hieght as the Face on Mars."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0843210248,<span style="color:white">0.8512589759999999</span>,0.0644200014]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The Snake River in Idaho is basically evidence that Cydonia isnt really a face and that is was just a buttle, or mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0730042796,<span style="color:white">0.8925058760000001</span>,0.0344898292]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">My third and final reason is, that all planets start off as a big ball of rock, meteors, and astroids that collide with each other.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.209883738,<span style="color:white">0.775564654</span>,0.0145515948]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The possiblities of a ball of rock, a planet, having left over craters from all of the collisions, is very high.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1112748319999999,<span style="color:white">0.855704622</span>,0.0330205662]</span>  <span style="color:white">If, somewhere way far out in space, or even just one planet away, wouldn't we have had a lot more pictures, videos, and newspaper articles about aliens?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.494326092</span>,0.4973512839999999,0.00832262426]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This is only three theories backed with evidence, and I'm sure that if you talk to any other of these wonderful scientists at NASA, that they can also provide more reasons with more evidence. Thus, I really hope that these reasons help you clearify that Cydonia is not a sign of Extra-Terrestrial activity.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.133445836,<span style="color:white">0.833045928</span>,0.033508241]</span>
