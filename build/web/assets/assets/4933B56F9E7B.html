Dear State Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">You should keep the electoral college vote the same without the popular vote</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because the winning candiate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Aswell as the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives majority of the votes cast.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">To begin, the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invairably exceeds his share of the popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">for example in the 2012 election, Oboma received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is very possible like the total number of votes-538-is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. It is less likely to have a dispute over the popular vote but it is more likely to have a dispute over the electoral vote. In 2012's election voters in toss-up states are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign- to really listen to the competing canidates- knowing they are going to decide the election. Causing the popualr vote to go up. When we as a community should not want to president be chosen by a popular vote but by the electoral vote, it is only fair!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also, the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives majority of the votes cast.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning the majority in the electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Did you know that there is someone from a small state and they only get three electoral votes. Well, they are not treated equal and only the large states get more of the attention from presidential candidates than a small state ever will.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">You should keep the electoral college vote the same without the popular vote</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because the winning candiate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Aswell as the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives majority of the votes cast.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  So I'm going to leave you with this. What will you choose? The popular vote of the electoral vote? It's up to you not.</br></br>Sincerly,</br></br>An american Citizen.       Â
