<span style="color:yellow">The Electoral College basically serves as a filter for the votes of every individual American citizen.

Why would they spend time trying to appeal to some of the smaller states? This can lead to some states not even seeing the candidate. Infact, during the 2000 election, voters in the 25 largest media markets did not witness any campaign advertising</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00901381148,0.2019924259999999,<span style="color:white">0.788993726</span>]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:yellow">The Electoral College's process of voting suppresses the voice of every citizen.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0054164403399999,0.205170832,<span style="color:white">0.7894127339999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The balance between smaller and larger states comes into play here as well. Take Florida for example, a state with 29 total electoral votes. If the mass majority of Florida votes for a certain set of electors, the minority votes for the other ones would not matter at all, as the electors speaking for that certain fraction of the population would not elected. With popular voting, each and every vote would matter towards electing a president. The number of minority votes would directly apply to the outcome of the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.02433884896,0.22386369,<span style="color:white">0.7517974839999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The Electoral College and the electors should not be the voice of the country. The voice of the people should be heard, especially when it comes to presidental elections. Popular voting is the most fair and rational method of voting.
