Assigning summer projects to assure students continue learning is an excellent idea, but allowing students to design their own projects may be more effective because all students are different. Anyone can complete a project with step-by-step instructions, but what matters is what is learned through the process. One set of explicit directions cannot satisfy every single students' needs and/or wants in a learning environment. In conclusion, the process of completing the project is more important than just getting it done.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0015179770339999,0.0889220734,<span style="color:white">0.909559944</span>]</span>
