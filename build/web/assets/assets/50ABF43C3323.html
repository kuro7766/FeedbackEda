<span style="color:orange">In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" a writer states that scientists are trying to study the planet Venus. In his article, he claims that while it is very risky, it may be worth it in the end. he also gives details about how dangerous it really is, and what the planet might have been at one point in time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.044141073,<span style="color:white">0.477184736</span>,0.478674192]</span> </br></br>In the second paragraph, <span style="color:yellow">The writer claims that Venus is referred to as Earth's "twin''. But the only evidence he gives to back up this claim is that "Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of desnity and size."</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.02238762016,0.39793183,<span style="color:white">0.57968055</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">but in reality, Earth and Venus are very differnet. Earth is much safer in terms of temperature, pressure, and gas compaired to Venus. Venus has a blanket of gas that covers it that is, "almost 97 percent carbon dioxide." Plus, on its surface, "temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit." with the level of carbon dioxide and the ragging heat that it has, nothing is safe for long on Venus, especially humans. He does state that several spacecrafts have attempted to land on Venus, and only lasted a few hours, but he doesnt state what happened to them. most people would guess that they just melted entirely because of the extreme heat, which is most likely what happened, but we don't know for sure.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01190458968,0.188708162,<span style="color:white">0.7993872399999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Not only is high temperatures and extreme pressures an issue, he also states that there are volcanoes and major earthquakes that happen, plus lightning is constant as well</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0324544794,<span style="color:white">0.564266352</span>,0.4032791899999999]</span> .

But there is nothing that follows it that claims what happened or could have happened to cause high pressures, high temperatures, and a high level of carbon dioxide to form.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.02430313934,0.357300636,<span style="color:white">0.618396222</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">While scientists believe that Venus was at one point like earth, there are some facts that show that it has the looks of earth in some ways.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.09234015,<span style="color:white">0.633535444</span>,0.27412441]</span>  <span style="color:orange">the writer says that Venus, "has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."
