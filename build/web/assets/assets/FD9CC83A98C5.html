Because i wasn't doing a after school sport at all and i didnt like sports at the time. So we talked about doing it and i tried it i kind of liked it it was fun because of the basketball drills and got to meet new friends on the team. after that i started doing flag football, and tackle football and i enjoyed it and i was always busy and occupied.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.338214154,<span style="color:white">0.6306353900000001</span>,0.0311504906]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">i think students who don't do any sports should try it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.163007428,<span style="color:white">0.8227578339999999</span>,0.01423473306]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because it will keep you busy and you would enjoy it because you meet new friends and its very competitive. other than that it will keep you from being on your phone and staying home all day bored when you can be out having fun playing sports. And also sports would make you think about what you wanna do in the future if you really like sports and good at it. It would also make your family proud of you because of all the hard work you did to get this opportunity. But it also takes time to be good at something only if you try. because thats the only way to get somewhere.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.271493896,<span style="color:white">0.6790620399999999</span>,0.0494440488]</span>
