<span style="color:yellow">High school is a very difficult environment for kids to learn in. Most kids are too busy trying to fit in or look cool, so they can be part of a clique.

It will help the mental state of students. It will also help the physical state by letting them get more rest and eating as much as they need to. They can also focus on other parts of life like getting a job or spending time with family instead of doing homework all night. Students will no longer have to take days off anymore bringing up the attendance in high school. Doing this can make high scool a much easier and less stressful environment to learn in.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.01037241422,<span style="color:white">0.47711327</span>,0.512514292]</span>
