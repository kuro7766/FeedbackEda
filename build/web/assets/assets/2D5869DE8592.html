<span style="color:orange">Wyat Gibson, former scientist from NASA, 1976. Today, spacecraft one has captured a image to what looks to appear as a face. Scientist figured it was just another Martain mesa. "Only this one photo had unusaul shadows that made it look like an Egyptain Pharoh.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> " <span style="color:orange">I predicted that it must have a degree of surpise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion lab when the face appeared on the monitiors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Some other scientist belived the face was an alien artfact. I snapped a picture ten times sharper than the oraginal Viking photos.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">I have done lots of reaserch, and revealed a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I reasched the photo a lot more. After a lot of rearch, I decoved that there was no alien monument after all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">We decieded that we still did not have enough evedience. Perhaps, alien markings were hidden by haze. Still there is no evedience as we continued.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">After more and more reasch. There is still no alien monument.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">We decovered that the picture is acually the Martian of a butte or mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They are landforms common around the American West. It's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about that same height as the face on mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In the end, there was not evedience of alien lifeform or artcraft. What we predicted might not be right, but it's defenitly not a sign of alien life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>
