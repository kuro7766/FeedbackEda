<span style="color:white">Aliens are real, Frank I'm telling you. The aliens made that face on Mars. Why do you think that, Grayson? No one can step on Mars. If a person steps on Mars, they will die. No one has ever been to Mars, Still to this day. Are you sure about what you are saying? I'm sure about this. Aliens live in the galaxy. They can step on any planet whenever they want to and not die.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.6773115319999999</span>,0.319765582,0.00292289738]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Well I have something to say.
