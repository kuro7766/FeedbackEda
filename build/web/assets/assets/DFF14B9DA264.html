This is evident when the text states,"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents." (7) This is concerning because people today tend to get distracted while driving a normal car. If the actual driving factor is taken away, drivers could get distracted by almost anything from technology to falling asleep. This would result in serious fatality to not only th person behind the wheel but to people around them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000667182008,0.0537739116,<span style="color:white">0.945558916</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">In addition, the new entertainment systems in a car may be a new and alien experiance, they point to a rough road ahead.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.001368210668,0.1303972649999999,<span style="color:white">0.868234492</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">In an attempt to get the driver to pay attention while driving a driverless car, entertainment systems may be inserted in the car. This is pointed out when the text says,"Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays." (8) Though these systems may keep the driver engaged, when it is time to take over the shift from watching or listening to a system to driving a car may take an extended period of time. The driver would also need to gain a sense of where he or she is while driving in order to take control. This would result in an increase in accident on the road.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000712051138,0.053126385,<span style="color:white">0.946161594</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">No one is perfect and accidents do happen but in a driverless car who is to blame?

The author includes this in the arguement when they say,"The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone." (5) This would decrease the amount of damages done to cars from running into or backing over things because the sensors have eyes where the driver does not. The sensors can provide an advantage to safe driving that would not come from any ordinary car.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00088818319,0.0685730904,<span style="color:white">0.930538742</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">All in all, driverless cars are unsafe and an illogical invention. The lack of attention that is needed when not driving a car will result in mass accidents and injuries when a driver is needed. Entertainment systems in cars only add to the danger in driverless cars and are unnecessary. Crashes and accidents can not be settled or avenged in court because there is no clear cause to the incident. Though the sensor technology incorporated in the driverless cars gives an advantage for braking and controling the vehicle, the bad outweighs the good in this situation. Driverless cars may be a thing of the future but as of right now, humans are not ready to hit the road without a person behind the wheel.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.000476109604,0.0448398218,<span style="color:white">0.9546840719999998</span>]</span>
