Dear Principal,</br></br>As a student of SCHOOL_NAME, <span style="color:orange">I disagree to have the new policy that students may not participate in sports or any other activities unless they have at least a B average grade.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  I disagree with this policy, because <span style="color:white">I think that many students work hard to get at least a B average, and maybe if the really love a sport and want to play in it then we should be fare and let them play.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Because then I think it wouldn't be fare if a student is just one or two points away from a B average and then not let them play, just because of one low grade or two points off.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So then if there are only a little bit of students with a B average then there would be no teams or sports because all of the kids would not be eligible,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">also in the school activities there wouldn't be many kids there so it wouldn't make the activities as fun.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Although I do agree with you that if they do not have good grades and if they have to many U' s then they should not be eligible to play.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Therefore if they really loved sports and wanted to play in them, then they would try to raise their grade for it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So I disagree about putting and changing this to become a school policy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
