"Empathy (feeling someone else's emtional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expression"(Ph9), when the author states this it shows that not all of our humanliy facial expressions give off our emotions.

Emotions are like feelings and can't 100% told by a computer. The pricing on this all of this must be tremendous and if school do want this technology they would have to consider that aspect of the deal.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
