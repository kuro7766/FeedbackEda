<span style="color:yellow">A president election is great but, there are some difficulties along the way of deciding who will be able to vote. People are asking themselves whether or not they should keep the electorial vote or get rid of it and have a popular voting method.

We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decied ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is niot fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made.

I mean if we want someone to be watching over us, and deciding what to do, we want someone who everyine agrees on. Just a few hundred poeoplpe choosing for you is nothing compared to approximatley more than a million people choosing for themselves.

Even when there were voters in states that had 25 of the largest media markets, they were not able to see not even one ad from the campaign.

With this letter being written, people should not wonder whether or not the electoral college should be abolished, and go with the popluar voting method. You shouldn't be thinking about just a couple of people, but of a whole nation and deciding who is worthy enough in our eyes to lead us to more victories with the popular voting method.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.00681586978,0.1702077184,<span style="color:white">0.822976408</span>]</span>
