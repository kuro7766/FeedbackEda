You help choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are usually voting for your candidates electors.</br></br>Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the elecotrs are selected and what their responsibilities are.</br></br>The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. So when you vote for your president your acually voting for the slate of electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.6966973299999999</span>,0.296458416,0.00684426584]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Having this Electoral College is so much help to our state workers.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.233863668,<span style="color:white">0.75551469</span>,0.0106216273999999]</span>  <span style="color:white">They dont actually have to do everything now...thanks to the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.574194564</span>,0.4229385019999999,0.00286693138]</span> </br></br>So please strive to help keep the Electoral College.</br></br>sincerely,</br></br>PROPER_NAME
