<span style="color:yellow">Many school systems now offer an option of attending online classes either in conjunction with a students school year classes or during summer break.

To this day I regret enrolling in that geometry course, as it moved at too fast of a pace to where I consequently find myself struggling to grasp those concepts today. Online courses simply cannot effectively supplement for a students present education in the classroom. Taking online courses does far more harm than any good to students by allowing easy potential for students to struggle to comprehend difficult material without teacher guidance, education at home provides easy accessibility to distractions and cheating without supervision, and long hours of comprehending massive amounts of material can leave the mind and body drained and exhausted. Teachers will always provide the best possible learning experience, and students should always take advantage of that resource.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.001412112766,0.20059126,<span style="color:white">0.7979966279999999</span>]</span>
