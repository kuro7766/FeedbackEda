<span style="color:orange">There is no prof that and alien could have done that. If they think that they need to have prof that they are right.

I actually do have prof and evidence about my opinion. On April 5,1998 they took a picture, it was ten times sharper than other pictures they took in the past. Although I get it that lots of people want it to be true that an alien did that, but with what prof?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>I also see why you all think this. <span style="color:orange">Many of you think that there are alien markings hidden by haze.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But I think this is wrong,</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because they again took another picture and again it showed nothing of alien like. All that was in the picture was a big landform that is also common in the United States. Like i've said this is just natural occuring stuff.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This happens on earth because of lava when it gets cooled. The same thing happend on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There is absoultly nothing to lie about or freak out about. Even if they wanted to have an alien to have done that they know that there would have been signs of life on Mars, and because there wasn't many people that think that there were actually aliens they didn't have a choice but to agree with us</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">So this is my opinion on what I think of the Face on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
