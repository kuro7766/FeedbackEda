I kind of support the use of cell phones even though I don't own one, I might ask for someone to use their's when I need to make a call.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Even though these events are rare,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">you might not know what will happen.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In my opinion, I would tell the principle to use policy 1.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If I asked all the students who have cell phones with them if they want policy 1, there would be a chance that most of them would say yes.
