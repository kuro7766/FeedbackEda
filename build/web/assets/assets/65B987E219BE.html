However, a significantly large number of drivers have found a loophole to evade getting a ticket and/or citation. They would not text and drive but instead they would have their cell phones in their hand but not actually text and drive. In order to counteract this loophole, some states have enforced a policy which states that a driver can be penalized for being in possession of a cell phone/mobile device when the vehicle is in motion. These policies are implemented so that no harm can occur due to cell phone usage while driving.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0022809925079999,0.1019692099999999,<span style="color:white">0.895749808</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Using cell phones or mobile devices while driving can negatively impact the vehicle that a driver is driving whether it be a coupe, sedan, crossover, minivan, or truck</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.00423178286,<span style="color:white">0.22417848</span>,0.771589718]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Texting while driving can lead to the quality of the vehicle declining due to any damage it may face such as a wreck.
