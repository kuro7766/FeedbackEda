Dear, Senator</br></br>Hi, my name is Khalyl Silver. I'm fourthteen years old, living in a small town in Florida called Boynton Beach. I go to Boynton beach community high school and i'm a freshmen. The reason why i'm sending a letter to you is because on my writing test they were talking the electoral college. <span style="color:orange">The question was should we keep the Electoral college or we should stick to voting for president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">I'm with we should just stay voting for president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">The reason i say that is because the Electoral college is that we should vote for the voters. But then they could be bad to choose. We all should have a say in voting. we shouldn't vote for the voters. We should vote for the president. As said in these passage i'm reading, it's says that (</br></br>under the Electoral college system vote not president, but for a slate of electors, who turn in elect the president.)</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I think we should do both, but the question is should we do Electoral college or we should stick to voting. Well we should stick to voting.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>From: PROPER_NAME
