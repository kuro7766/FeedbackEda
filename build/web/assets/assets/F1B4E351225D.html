Dear, Senator</br></br>Hi, my name is Khalyl Silver. I'm fourthteen years old, living in a small town in Florida called Boynton Beach. I go to Boynton beach community high school and i'm a freshmen. The reason why i'm sending a letter to you is because on my writing test they were talking the electoral college. <span style="color:orange">The question was should we keep the Electoral college or we should stick to voting for president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.402479468,<span style="color:white">0.593753068</span>,0.00376743828]</span>  <span style="color:white">I'm with we should just stay voting for president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.28748853</span>,0.7072799780000001,0.0052315012599999]</span>  <span style="color:white">The reason i say that is because the Electoral college is that we should vote for the voters. But then they could be bad to choose. We all should have a say in voting. we shouldn't vote for the voters. We should vote for the president. As said in these passage i'm reading, it's says that (</br></br>under the Electoral college system vote not president, but for a slate of electors, who turn in elect the president.)</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.6397357699999999</span>,0.355173488,0.0050907557799999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I think we should do both, but the question is should we do Electoral college or we should stick to voting. Well we should stick to voting.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.647042908</span>,0.350964242,0.001992856128]</span> </br></br>From: PROPER_NAME
