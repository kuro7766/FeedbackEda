So NASA will keep studying the information they have.</br></br>Also NASA is trying to develop more information about this landmark. But until then this is known to be a landmark.</br></br>So until then this meeting is pronounced over.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1941933388,<span style="color:white">0.7912294340000001</span>,0.0145772332]</span>
