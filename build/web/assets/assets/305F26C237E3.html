<span style="color:orange">I am all for this new technology to read peoples emotions</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If we could read their emotions it would be easier to help people to get better if they are in a bad place in life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It would help so many people that are depressed and need help but afrad ask for it</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . And <span style="color:orange">when people get help with their emotions they become more stable then they were before.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Im all for the values of using this new emotion technology because you tell if people are faking a smile. You can tell because when you fake it you dont use the same muscles as when you really smile. When you fake smile the muscles you use are zygomatic major that make your mouth stretche sideways and the risori. But when you really smile you use the muscles called zygomatic major that begin at your cheek bones and life the corners of your mouth. The other muscle you use is called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus which makes crow's-feet around your eyes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This is way i think we should use this technology in the futer. It could help with so many things. People could get the help they need. Life would just be so much better if we all could understand each other. This will be one of the best things you can do for someone needs and wants help to make their life and friends and familys lifes better.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
