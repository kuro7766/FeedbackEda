Dear, Senator PROPER_NAME</br></br>My name is PROPER_NAME and i am attending SCHOOL_NAME in LOCATION_NAME.</br></br><span style="color:orange">I have recently been learning about the electoral college. i have been learning alot about it, actually,</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">i have to say. the electoral college sounds like a really bad idea!</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">First off, swing states? that sounds completely unfair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  sure <span style="color:orange">its good for states like Texas, California, and New york.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but what of the smaller states like Montana, or Maine, or Wyoming even? they deserve as much of a voice as the others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Also, <span style="color:white">this is presidency here, not what game we should play in Gym! majority vote makes absolutely NO sense whatsoever. I mean come on, we are deciding the next LEADER of our country!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Again. everyones wishes should be accounted for.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Now im not saying that popular vote is perfect either</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but it sure beats the college. there are too many variables for the college. too many areas where something can go wrong.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If something gets tied then they just throw the vote to the house of represenitives. I think if there is a tie that it should result in a re-election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  But thats probably just me (personally i think it should be like the hunger games).</br></br><span style="color:white">Well thats really all I have to say. I hope you read this letter and maybe you can send it to your superiors or whoever it is you work for to get my letter read by the President. And see if we can fix this problem here.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Yours Truly,</br></br>PROPER_NAME
