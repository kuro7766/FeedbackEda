<span style="color:yellow">In America today many students are now doing online schooling. These students do school on their computers which requires an obtuse amount of reading. Students do their work online while often times attending video conferences. A handful of parents believe getting an education online is not giving their children what they need to get a full education. They believe there is nothing to gain from online school that you won't get from public school. But many disagree with that sentiment. Is public school really ultimately the best option for students?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.00459157664,0.149587857,<span style="color:white">0.8458205480000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Many americans currently struggle everyday with health problems. This can make things hard as resources are limited and some things might not be as accessible for some individuals. People with hypothyroidism often times have difficulty focusing. This can be especially difficult for students as a teacher may give directions and the student could easily miss them. Individuals who have hypothyroidism often times have what's nick named the thyroid stare. They space out and become unaware of their surroundings, including the teacher talking. Another symptom of hypothyroidism is confusion. Students could forget where things are and forget directions even when they hear them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.001797430194,0.0954409265999999,<span style="color:white">0.902761636</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">With online classes, directions are often written out or replayable. One could replay directions as much as they needed to without having a teacher get frustrated with them. This makes the problems that many who suffer from hypothyroidism face much more managable.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0013101001,0.1200342339999999,<span style="color:white">0.878655682</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Not only can online school benefit people with hypothyroidism but also people struggling with ADHD. ADHD can effect someones ability to focus in a classroom setting. A student may get distracted and miss the directions a teacher is giving. A student may also end up missing important announcements. People with ADHD struggle to stay silent and sit still for long periods of time. They need some form of an outlet to let the energy they build up out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0037789417399999,0.175391939,<span style="color:white">0.8208291220000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Doing school work at home could give an individual with ADHD an outlet to let out energy by giving them breaks inbetween classes. A student could use the break to run outside or do a physical activity. Once they get back from taking a break they will be calmer and more focused.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.001148123792,0.105638282,<span style="color:white">0.89321359</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Individuals who have disabilities that greatly impact their ability to move and walk could find that online schooling could make learning a lot easier for them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00189726328,0.1615015719999999,<span style="color:white">0.836601176</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">If a person is Immobile, getting to school every day could be a great struggle. Most parents would want to do every thing to make it easier for them; one way to do that is with online schooling. You do not have to go anywhere to do online classes as you can do them all at home.

Anxiety varies person to person and for some individuals it can be worse than others. Some people have anxiety so severe it renders them unable to speak. A school environment, where most other students are constantly assuming everyone they meet can speak, could cause the student a great amount of stress. Transgender people often struggle with a lot of anxiety in school day to day. Many are too anxious to use the bathrooms at schools and hold it in for the whole day. Many are often also misgendered at school every day which induces a lot of stress for trans people, however, All of this added stress can be avoided with online school. There are no students to misgender trans students or to assume students are able to speak. Transgender Students can go to the bathroom at home without being stress.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.001411656846,0.0640092734,<span style="color:white">0.934579112</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">One thing that effects teenagers today the most is depression. Depression effects an abundance of students on a day to day basis. For some individuals it can come and go but for some it can last longer. Some students have it for weeks and some for even longer. The people who suffer from it the longest are chronically depressed. Depression can make someone unable to get out of bed in the morning. It can make an individual see trying to get an education as pointless and make them stop caring about their future.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00547408944,0.1847053248,<span style="color:white">0.80982057</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Being able to do school online can't fix everything for a student struggling with depression, but it can make things easier.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00252700796,0.201185658,<span style="color:white">0.7962873279999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Online classes make it so a student struggling with depression won't have to juggle going to school with getting out of bed in the morning. They can do school work later in the day or even in bed.
