<span style="color:orange">I do not agree that the face on Mars was made by aliens for a couple of reasons.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The reason one because nobody has found life on Mars</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Only samples that they can never find to be true</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Another reason for my disagreement is because even if there were some aliens that made that face the government wouldn't leak that information to the public</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">because that is something they would call classified just to keep everybody from going insane.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I also disagree because in paragragh seven when they flew over Cydonia for the first time on April 5,1998 they said that there was no alien monument after all</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">From my understanding what the last paragrah is saying is it is just a landform not created by aliens just made by land such as dirt,dust,mud or whatever is on that planet. Also in the three pictures that look like they are changing every year they took the pictures so maybe Mars has storms which causes the dirt or dust to shift or move around I mean u wouldn't say the aliens know what time the scientist take the pictures so the change the look of the face that would be outragoues.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The last reason for me thinking that the face is a landform and it was not created by aliens is because it clearly states in the reading that they found out it was just a "messa brutte"</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">which is a landform so that gives the answer right there.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This is why I degree with whoever says that aliens formed the face on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
