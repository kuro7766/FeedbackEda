If you were going to have to do this why not you put your foot on the pedals as wheel and just drive a car yourself and not pay the ridiculous prices that this car will consist of. In paragraph 7 it also says "human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires" , if the point of this car is to be driverless then why should a human have to be alert and take over?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01349536964,0.3145663099999999,<span style="color:white">0.671938318</span>]</span>  Finally the last negative aspect to this car is the legal issues that it will bring. <span style="color:orange">In paragraph 9 it states that " in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars". The reason to this law is because states want to make sure that drivers, passagers, and pedestrians are safe, the law, makers believe that safety is best</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0411425587,<span style="color:white">0.528400348</span>,0.4304570863999999]</span>
