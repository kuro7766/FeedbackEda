Dear Mr. Principal 1/8/11</br></br><span style="color:orange">I don't think that you should not change the school policy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I think that people work hard enough to get into sports already.</br></br>Getting a B average can be difficult.</br></br>Students need time to practice sports too.</br></br>I agree that students need to have good grades to play sports.</br></br>Part of the reason is because most students right now would not be able to play because they have a C average.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think most students should be allowed to get a couple of C' s because it is a passing grade.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">What if sport players don't understand one class but do ok in other classes that's not fair to them.</br></br>Players will also think that if they cant play because they don't have a good enough grade average they might think that they are letting people down.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">All students have been talking about this.</br></br>Some students are better at sports than school work.</br></br>Maybe you will consider that changing the school policy will be a bad idea.</br></br>You may think different But i hope you will change your mind.</br></br>If students cant play any sports than who will represent us in the school?</br></br>If students did not write you, you should take some time and ask them what they think.</br></br>I hope you can clearly see the other side to this now.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
