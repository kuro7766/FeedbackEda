This shows that they are already testing new methods that could possibly survive on Venus. In paragraph 7, it says, "Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers...system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces." This proves that they are using all resources that even date back to the 1800s.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.1759708064,0.6812881899999998,<span style="color:white">0.1427410016</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">To be able to land on Venus, we'll need to use what we already know about Venus</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.208500128,<span style="color:white">0.760616156</span>,0.0308837317399999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">In paragraph 3, it says, "such environment would crush even a submarine...and would liquefy many metals."
