Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I am fully aware you probably think it is better for the school to not have cell phones during school hours.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">But I have reason to say that students should be able to have use in there phone during lunch periods and other free times but yet to have it off during class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The reason for this is because I tend to get bored during lunch time</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">if I have absolutely nothing to do maybe I could just listen to music on my phone or to text a friend that is away.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">As well as if I needed to talk to my mom I could call her for something important to me,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I say important to me because If I asked the people in the office if I could use the phone to ask my mom or a parent something, and did not tell them why because it was a personal question, they would normally say "no".</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I really don't see what is wrong with having a phone out during the time we have free.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Kids do it either way, whether the teachers say yes or no, But kids sometimes get there phone look-in away. There for, I say we should be able to have use of a cell phone.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  I would rather much talk to you about this in person. Please respond to this letter I have sent you. <span style="color:white">Hopefully it would change your mind about this policy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>  If it didn't, sorry for bothering/interrupting your day. Thank you if you have read this paper I have wrote you.</br></br>Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME.
