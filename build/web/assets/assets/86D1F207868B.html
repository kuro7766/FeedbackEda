<span style="color:orange">Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Some people may feel that it is better to have these projects student-designed rather than designed by the teacher themselves. Both project criterias have their positves and negatives, but the teachers should be the ones making the assignment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0806053584,<span style="color:white">0.8357972120000001</span>,0.0835974184]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Now while a student-designed project has its benefits, the teachers should be designing the assignments</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0473664898,<span style="color:white">0.8775803400000001</span>,0.0750531724]</span>  because <span style="color:white">what is best for the student</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.116519862</span>,0.85575295,0.02772720134]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">the material the students must know before coming to the class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1323875662,<span style="color:white">0.8309193300000001</span>,0.0366931059999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This statement could be countered with a claim that states that the students should design these assignments to help insure that they better understand the material.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0765864506,<span style="color:white">0.857372052</span>,0.0660415214]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The students could make a project that is accustomed to their own personality and the way they think.

The student has not yet taken the course and is not as familiar with the information as the teacher is. The student would be more beneficial by having the teacher tell them what they need to know and learn before taking the course. I believe these things because the teacher has more experience in this field than the student does.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.118463919,<span style="color:white">0.829350142</span>,0.0521859454]</span> </br></br>Overall, both ideas are great and really help them learn the material well, I just believe that the student would be better off by having the teacher design the assignment. The teachers know exactly the material the student needs to know to be successful in the course. The teacher have spent years familiarizing themselves with the information invoved in the course.
