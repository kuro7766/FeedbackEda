Technology cannot calculate humans expressions because humans emotion and facial expression varies from time to time and based on what there are seeing and feeling at the moment, so technology cannot calculate human expressions. If technology can calculate humans feelings the our phone or other electronics devices should have been able to tell us where we want to go to at a particular moment, and be able to know when calls should come in or not.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.26136849,<span style="color:white">0.7323906320000001</span>,0.0062408711]</span>
