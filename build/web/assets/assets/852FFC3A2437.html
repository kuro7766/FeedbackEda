I also believe that in life we have to go threw a path on our own ; there would be sacrifice , tears and smiles but its apart of growing up and facing reality. Not everyone gets the same amount of help as the other person. Some people just need their worth to try living on their own. A bunch of students dont have a mom , dad or they dont even have both. Some student live their lifes without parents , who will they be able to trust ? In this article , I believe other people like this idea that their willing to help people out but some people rather just face their problems on their own.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Dont get me wrong though .
