To my state senator, <span style="color:orange">i feel like you should keep the electoral college</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.14817095,<span style="color:white">0.8439503800000001</span>,0.00787866454]</span>  <span style="color:white">because it helps kids in college figure out how the election goes and for them to vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.468280148</span>,0.527944582,0.0037752996599999]</span>  " the electoral college process consists of 538 electors." the only way people can vote is when there 18 and thats not right i think 15 and up should be able to vote, i guess its the law how people gotta wait till there 18 to vote for presidents and senators and stuff like that. "under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the electoral college". they should be able to use a popular vote to, if you be fair to one you gotta be fair to the other one.</br></br>"ths year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency! the are too many broken down states with a electoral vote!!! they easily choose a state and send a lot of votes to them !!!!
