Dear, Principle</br></br><span style="color:white">I am writing to you today to tell you that picking up liter would be a good idea</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I think that students should do community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">it is good for the community and the country. I think we can all get together and do that to help out our city.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But there will be some people that will probably disagree with me. There will be lazy people that will not do it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Then there are some that will. So we have to come together and make this happen</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">And get a group of people in our community and pick up trash on the side of the road or just recycle. And that will make this a better community. For example make a group of people that will pick up trash on the side of the road, and a group that will recycle. And a way that will get the lazy people up is compete against each other and see who does a better job. And at the end the group that gets the most trash picked up or recycled gets a surprise. And the next time we do it the lazy people will probably get up and do it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">And maybe we can hold like a big carnival or something like that. For them at the end of the contest. And a big mile race to raise money for the community and get better equipment for the job to pick up trash. And we can raise money to build a Community park or a city swimming pool. For the family's of our community. And at the end of the year the team with the most points for the trash pick up and the recycling. will get a surprise for the effort they put.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">So these are some of my ideas</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>  i hope you fell the same way i do.</br></br>Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
