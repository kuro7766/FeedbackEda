The reason has alot to do with the fact that a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide covers Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venuss atmosphere.</br></br>On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which means that its alot of times hotter than the surface of our planet. The atmospheric pressure is also 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. Also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.303657022,<span style="color:white">0.637488452</span>,0.058854525]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">With all that being said, why would we want to go back there.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.305420916</span>,0.685834222,0.0087448516]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The reason is because Astronomers think that the Venus was once an earth like planet. They believe that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Adding more into this is that today, Venus has some features such as mountains and valleys.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.32118901,<span style="color:white">0.665753978</span>,0.01305701314]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">NASA has come up with an idea on how they would live in</br></br>Venus safely and productive.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1811557528,<span style="color:white">0.79908956</span>,0.01975470494]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The idea is to allow scientist to float above ground. About 30 miles to be exact. With them hovering 30 miles above ground they should be safe from the ground conditions. With that, NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus; such as an device that was used in World War 2 that calculates under high pressure of heat and does not require electricity.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.3209714979999999,<span style="color:white">0.6630080900000002</span>,0.0160204142599999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I love the idea of going back to Venus and exploring because we are humans and we have an unlimited imagination.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.235596858</span>,0.7476689639999999,0.016734123]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If we want to truly be a civilization, We should be at least a two planet species.
