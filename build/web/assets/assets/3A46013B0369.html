Technology safety</br></br><span style="color:orange">Today many people are using technology for many reasons but there is one piece of technology that has been used a lot more recently. The smartphone or mobile phone, many people think that it is not that dangerous but it is as dangerous as most things that can damage or hurt people just not as much. As it can hurt people in many ways the most severe way is to be in a car accident just by looking at a phone for even a second. Not only could that person hurt themself but whomever else is in the car or the person they have crashed into. If it is such a bad way to drive why don't people stop looking at their phones while driving?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.02745267048,<span style="color:white">0.57098347</span>,0.40156387]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Well many people are worried about how their social status is doing and how their friend's day is rather than their safety.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0478130834,<span style="color:white">0.850004064</span>,0.1021828656]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So even if the majority of people were to stop there would always be that other percent who don't care. Although drivers should not they would still need their phones for GPS. Many states already have this situation classified as illegal but some states do not. Even if they were to turn the sound some people may not know where 1/2 miles to turn is.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1352414912,<span style="color:white">0.8117334599999999</span>,0.0530250548]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">There are consequences to driving with a person on his or her phone but in some states they should not even if there should be.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.393500338</span>,0.5971071840000001,0.0093924681799999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It should be illegal to drive using their phones.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.073857879,<span style="color:white">0.8860219779999999</span>,0.0401201246]</span>  <span style="color:orange">People who drive with phones should get a ticket and they should have to pay the fine or they would get jail time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.060431644,<span style="color:white">0.8476466</span>,0.091921779]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Many people do not realise just how dangerous not looking at their surroundings are when driving a car.

It is illegal in some states and some in not but even in the illegal states people still do it knowing they could cause damage to someone or themselves or even pay a fine. It should be illegal anywhere so people can think about whether or not they want to get a ticket. People should stop to think that they may make someone's day worse. People should just stop using their phones while driving in general but not everyone chooses to do it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0465782414,<span style="color:white">0.82221118</span>,0.131210583]</span>
