Every state has 1 House of Representative plus 2 of your Senators in the Electoral College.

In order to win the vote you have to convice the electoral college and thats not always easy. So remember just because you won popular vote doesnt mean you won the majority of the electoral vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.130594784,<span style="color:white">0.844462426</span>,0.0249427914]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There are 5 reasons why we keep this method of electing the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.127848391,<span style="color:white">0.85009031</span>,0.0220612934]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The first reason is Certainty of Outcome. This means "it's less likley than a dispute over the popular vote." Which really means the candidates share to the other people in the Electoral college there share of the popular vote and thats how they vote. The second reason is Everyone's President. This is basically shows that "the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal." This means that no region such as south,northwest,etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The third resone to keeping these methods is Swing States. This tells me that its the "winner takes all method." The fourth method why we should keep these methods is the Big States. This explains that "the Electoral College restores some of the wieght in the political balance." this means that the bigger states get a big advantage in the electoral because the people that get elected into office there is based off of population so they have an advantage. THe bigger states get more attention from the candates then the smaller states do. The final reason why we should keep this method of voting is Avoid Run-Off Elections. This means "the Electoral College aviods the problem of Elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast". This means no pressure for candidates when they win majority of the votes cast.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.2244844739999999,0.6567322320000001,<span style="color:white">0.1187832574</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There are many ways to develop and to hold the Electoral College together. There are many ways that it falls apart and has it flaws but its the best way for our econany to vote for president. If you think about it if we just did popularity vote that would be like leading our hands into a world of immigrates who know a very little. There a lot of rules for our Electoral process buyt its the best way and the only way we have to becoming a better place. Dont forget to look at the 5 reasons we keep this the way it is.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1486978608,<span style="color:white">0.79204517</span>,0.0592569763999999]</span>
