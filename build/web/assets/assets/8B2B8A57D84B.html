<span style="color:orange">We should go to Venus even with its dangers</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">We humans could find out so many things if we do. There might be animal life or even oceans with life in it. We could learn what the ground texture is like. Even learn abiut the gases that are on the planet.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">If we find life on Venus it would prove that their are other life out there</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:white">There could be life under the ground but we wouldn't know that cause we cant even get to the surface of the plant. If there is life on the plant we could learn how they world by watching. Maybe even with pictures. With oceans we could find if there are organisms in it. It would prove that there is a different kind of life on the planet.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">With learning about the ground we could see what minarals it holds.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">If its the same kind we have on earth or if there are ones we dont even know of. If we could grow plants in the soil or if there are plants growing in it. If we go under the ground there could be worm like creatures or even caves. Who knows how big the caves could be or what could be in it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Now with getting to Venus. We would need a ship or rover that could with stand the pressure of the plant</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:white">One that could maybe could go under ground and have something stick out from the ground every once in awhile. Maybe even one that could stay in the water of the plant. If we can build a ship that can with stand all of Venuses wearher. Than we could study it freely.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This is why i think we should go to Venus. Or make a ship to Venus. With Venus we could learn many things. Find minarals we dont have on earth. Maybe even find more simalaerities between are planets.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
