Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think we should make everyone do community service!</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">It could let people have a different aspect on the community</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:white">Newton County is not that clean and not everybody is superb in school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  I have some thoughts and questions about how you are going to make students do this.</br></br><span style="color:orange">First, Newton County has lots of liter!</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">We have to do something about it. Certain students should be assigned roads and highways and pick up as much trash as possible every Friday! Then we can pride in of county. It will be so much more delightful.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Another idea is to tutor students every other day!</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If we have eighth grade students tutor sixth and seventh grade students then hopefully our AP scores will improve</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> ! Your probably wondering how this will help the eighth graders. Well, you have to know something before you can teach it to somebody else, right? If all eight graders know the material then all of us will have to tutor someone! You can make it required so that everyone will have to learn all the material!</br></br>Lastly, I have a concern. <span style="color:orange">I'm not sure how you could make everyone do community service because some students have after school activities and you can't make them stop for other people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  Please let me know soon, so I can help you!</br></br>Thank you for reading my letter! I hope you consider my ideas. I'm really looking forward to community service. It's a pleasure to be writing to you.</br></br>Thank You, STUDENT_NAME
