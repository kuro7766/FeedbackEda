Dear School Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe that changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is a bad decision.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.01406286092,<span style="color:white">0.45843322</span>,0.52750391]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">If the school policy was changed there would not be many students participating in sports or other activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.01645575668,0.4734826179999999,<span style="color:white">0.5100616240000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Many students have a grade C average which would inconvenient them from participating in school sports and/or activities.</br></br>Not many students who have a grade B average are athletic to participate in sports but would enjoy participating in school activities such as clubs. But if there are not enough students to participate in school sports it would just be a waste of money to purchase equipment for those sports. Many students who play sports have a grade C average and are very athletic students. It would also be unfortunate for students who do play sports to not be able to participate if they have a grade C average. If those students do not participate they would probably not participate in school activities that they do not enjoy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0353896326,0.408231476,<span style="color:white">0.556378848</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Changing school policy is also a bad idea because many students rely on athletic scholarships to get into college since not all families are lucky enough to send their children to college without having to worry about have financial problems doing so</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.01686635796,0.3719290379999999,<span style="color:white">0.611204608</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">But since the prices for college tuition is going up not many students have enough money to attend college right after high school. Many of those students also have a grade C average. Also many students who are very good at sports but not very academically skilled may see that sports are what help them get by in life. Those students also find it very difficult to get into a good college they can afford if they have a grade C average but do not have a chance to get into a college if they cannot get a scholarship for athleticism.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0297174787,0.390911664,<span style="color:white">0.579370846</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So I hope you reconsider of changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average because not many students do. Those students may also rely on baseball or football scholarships to get into college if they cannot afford it on their own. Also they schools would be wasting money for buying sports equipment if there are not enough students for those sports to play since many of them have a grade C average.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0262623897999999,<span style="color:white">0.577840032</span>,0.395897578]</span>
