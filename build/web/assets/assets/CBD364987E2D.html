Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school around free time and at lunch periods.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0495050412,<span style="color:white">0.937810906</span>,0.0126840479999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think that the kids at schools would be a lot happier with more freedom.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.052002727,<span style="color:white">0.936745888</span>,0.0112513608999999]</span>  <span style="color:white">I also, think that with more freedom would become more responsibility, and i think that the students in the school could handle having their cell phones out during passing time and also during lunch periods. Many people would like to have that freedom of having our cell phones out. Also, i think that if we were able to have our cell phones and do things with them then we would be a lot happier and things would be a lot better at Warren Woods Middle</br></br>School</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.260981456</span>,0.728633528,0.0103850106]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I think that in classes cell phones could be used a lot with different assignments.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0795115924,<span style="color:white">0.912532158</span>,0.0079562432199999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Such as we could be texting a teacher our answers or looking things up. Also, you could play the quiet game and then just have our phones and then we could be texting each other back and forth about question and other sorts of things</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1737365328,<span style="color:white">0.818260002</span>,0.0080034507]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I think that if we were allowed to have cell phones in school then we would only be able to have them outside of the class room and if had them any where else then we would have to get them taken away and also, then maybe cell phones would be band from schools. I think that the principal should be able to trust us to have our cell phones.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.369414946,<span style="color:white">0.62672206</span>,0.00386295582]</span>
