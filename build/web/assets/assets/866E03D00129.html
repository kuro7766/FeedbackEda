Meaning that people express their emotions by their looks or their actions, but they chose when to do this. The Facial Action Coding System takes away this freedom from students, they do not have the choice when to express what they are feeling if anyone can just use a face scanning system on them. " Imagine being able to detect exaclty how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions (D'Alto 1)," this first sentence perfectly shows how it takes away peoples freedom of when they want to express certian emotions tocertian people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0267300354,0.377512346,<span style="color:white">0.59575764</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Every human has naturaul rights, and in America everyone has the right to freedom of speech.
