<span style="color:orange">Hi, my name is Decaon. And I work for NASA. I am here to discuss the face on mars. Many people think that it was created by aliens</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">But I am here to explain why it wasn't created by aliens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The first photo was taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 Spacecraft. The craft was circleing Mars trying to find a spot for its sister ship to land. The Viking 2 Spacecraft.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The first reason to why people think it is alien. Is the quality of the pictures that were taken.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The first picture was taken in 1976 so the resolution of the picture wasnt very good. Which caused it to look like there was a nose, eyes and a mouth. But pictures that were taken years after show that it could have been the quality.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>There is another reasonable explanation. <span style="color:yellow">During july 1976 it would have been winter on mars at the time. So that means the storms on mars could have casted a shadow.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:white">But many still believe that it is alien. Even though this some of the best evidence to peove the face on mars isnt alien but a mistake.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>But the most compelling reason is. <span style="color:yellow">It is simialr to some of the rock formations that we have on Earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Scientist have found that in the western United States there are rock formations that are very similar. They are simailasr to the snake river palin in Idaho.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>After a lengthy expalnation.

That are found on Earth as well as On Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>  And i hope This has been very informative for you.
