With this new technology students could continue focusing on what's important, their school work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00671028616,0.2742611,<span style="color:white">0.719028656</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">This would make students grades improve and allow them to have a better oppurtunity in the real world. Occording to the text, the technology would also allow "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." This means the technology could adjust itself to learn how the student works, instead of the other way around. Also "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal," meaning that the technology would work for each student around the world.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0270293334999999,0.5388246,<span style="color:white">0.4341460919999999</span>]</span> </br></br>Body 2- <span style="color:yellow">This technology would also create a better living environment across the globe.

This is all plausible because the text omits that the technology "could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This could make jobs easier for teachers, and increase the future generations knowledge by teaching them more than a human could.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.028581318,0.560623308,<span style="color:white">0.410795364</span>]</span> </br></br>Conclusion- <span style="color:yellow">This technology could seriosly improve schools for the better and allow them to forever change how we learn. Students could be individually taught, and they would always learn because the computer would still know if the student is confused or not. This could create worldwide peace because students could fully grasp from histories mistakes and continue to forever make the world a better place.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0120483917999999,0.385465448,<span style="color:white">0.6024861520000001</span>]</span>
