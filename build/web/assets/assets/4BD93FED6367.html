<span style="color:white">A Face on Mars, or just a common mesa? Many skeptics belive that the mesa on Mars, located at 41 degrees north martian latitude, is proof of ancient alien civilazation. In 1976, when NASA's Viking 1 crossed over a landform that showed "shadowy likeness" of a human face. When NASA revealed the picture to the public, thinking it would be a good way to draw attention to Mars, caused an uproar.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.0606243006</span>,0.665832078,0.273543586]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">A few years later, Micheal Malin and his team took a picture 10x sharper than that of the Viking 1 spacecraft. When the photo first appeared online, it showed nothing but a common mesa that can be found in the American west.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0492629409999999,<span style="color:white">0.79885249</span>,0.1518845891999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Again skepics were not satisfied, the picture was taken on a cloudy day over Mars.

They used the camera's "absolute maximum resolution." Yet again, showing nothing but a common landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.064087649,<span style="color:white">0.8224402660000001</span>,0.1134720932]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Well what if NASA is hiding evidence of ancient alein life on Mars?</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.195092638,<span style="color:white">0.776086406</span>,0.0288209766]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Why would NASA hide groundbreaking news like this?
