Students could help each other master the material by reading it over with each other or quizzing each other on the material. If a student cant be with a teacher after school for whatever reason they could go to a student in their class for help. Sometimes getting help from one of your classmates can be better than getting help from a teacher. These are ways students could get help in school from having extracurricular activities and have more success in their classes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0121246176399999,0.3125083832,<span style="color:white">0.675367016</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">By being in a extracurricular activity like book club or yearbook, it could be an opportunity for students to become more social and meet new people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00912692496,0.3611829079999999,<span style="color:white">0.6296901540000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Some students could be quiet and anti-social but, by being in these activities they could meet new friends and people to talk to at school.

This is how being in an extracurricular activity can help students get to know their school, the people that work there, and make the school a better environment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01736072406,0.371500304,<span style="color:white">0.6111389819999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think having every student be in a extracurricular activity is a great idea and it should be implemented into the school.
