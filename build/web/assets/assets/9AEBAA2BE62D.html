Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe the way the American Goverment is run is injust and outdated. I believe this because the way we as America elect a new president is unfair to many people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The reason I say that is the electoral college is unjust is 538 people should'nt be voting for more than a billion people</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The way I believe our new President should be selected is by a majority rule, which ever Canidate has the most votes should win not based off people who vote for our state we live in. Even though the majority of the time the representative from his or her state votes depending on the popular vote from there state, but the reason im saying this is that he or she has the power to pick whatever he or she wants</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Also another reason would be that the people only vote for a slate whether it be democratic or republic people in the slate can just change there mind and pick a differnt side. I would understand this system before our time</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but now we have so much technology people can vote from anywhere they dont have to go put a paper in a box anymore. The system is outdated and unfair to many people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Some people would argue against the point that the representative votes depending on his or her states popular vote, but there has been and will be more of the representative picking against his state if it stays like this.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>If this actually ever does get to you I hope you take into consideration some of the points I have given you. <span style="color:orange">Like I said before the Electoral College system is outdated and unfair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
