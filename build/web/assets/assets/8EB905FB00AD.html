Well i beg to plead the opposing side see what you have seen from 1976,1998, and 2001 is technology has proccesed this and its clearly nothing but a mark. Your conspiracy will live on if this was a life form why would it only be one life form? where are the others there are no trace of them a form of life can not just be created by nothing it has to reproduce.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.539144648,<span style="color:white">0.4566052499999999</span>,0.00425012496]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There is only sign of one so there for it does not exist as of the evidence given it is simply just a mesa, a mesa is a rock formation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.101373164,<span style="color:white">0.8881087759999999</span>,0.0105180522]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">this is just a coincedence that it looks of so nasa revealed they wish there was life form to give us more to study of but not much evidence comes from a plain old rock that looks like a face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.247008186,<span style="color:white">0.748975988</span>,0.00401583752]</span>  <span style="color:white">in conclusion you personally will not change your mind about this becuase it a conspiracy life has been held up by this making money off of this rejoicing of nothing but a rock. Just like area 51 another conspiracy theorys where there is claimed to be unexposed life form when really its just a testing site for us millitary. Also the illumanati claimed to be the ones running the music industry and society. there many conspiracy theorys, but maybe just maybe theyare controlling us of what they dont want us to know making people think the conspiracys are a joke when in reality they are true. Iastly nothing can come off a rock as i said its a natural formation a rock to be 'told'.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.6629271400000001</span>,0.3331475499999999,0.0039253274]</span>
