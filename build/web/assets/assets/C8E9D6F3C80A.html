reasons.</br></br>Those reasons include ensuring that they have less work, creating an easy way to cheat the assignment, and fabricating the idea that they are actually learning and maintaining new information.</br></br>Students see summer as a break from work and stress, and with a summer assignment that they are assigned to create, they will take any shortcuts they can discover.</br></br>For example, if a teacher assigns a self-reflective summer assignment for the AP Language class, a student could create a set of five flashcards and call it a day.</br></br>With no guidelines to be enforced, how will the students effectively learn the material that the teachers assign?</br></br>Teachers need to create the assignments in order to enforce a strong way of learning.</br></br>If not, then students will cheat their way through the work and not be prepared for the start of a new year.</br></br><span style="color:orange">Work is a concept that no student enjoys.</br></br>If students were to create their own summer assignment, they would spend even more time thinking about what they would want to do rather than actually fulfilling the needed criteria.</br></br>If a Junior in High School is assigned a summer assignment in which they have full control, they would need to create a meaningful and efficient piece of work that would assist them in maintaining and learning the information needed for the class.</br></br>Assuming that the student has a rigorous summer schedule, where would they have the time to effectively plan and carry out a summer assignment in which they can comprehend the information necessary for the class?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.00714849438,<span style="color:white">0.179754224</span>,0.81309728]</span> </br></br><span

the education for a particular branch of psychology to prepare for a test that we would receive in our first week back.</br></br>Everyone did different branches of psychology, but we all did the same content.</br></br>Basically we all answered the same questions when it came to the assignment.</br></br>Needless to say most of my class ended up passing the test with flying colors.</br></br>The ones that didn't do well were those that went off on their own tangents.</br></br>A buddy of mine created his own worksheet that consisted of incorrect information, which led to him failing the test.</br></br>He told me afterward that the instructions said to come up with your own resource to study for the test, and that's what he did, leading him to fail.</br></br><span

student.</br></br>Summer assignments are meant to help students learn and prepare for the next school year.</br></br>They aren't meant to trick and deceive students into thinking that they can fudge
