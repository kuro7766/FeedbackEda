<span style="color:orange">My position on driverless cars is, that they wont be as safe as cars driven by humans.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  i believe this because <span style="color:orange">they wouldnt know when to stop</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">they might go out of control</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , and <span style="color:orange">they wouldnt be very surportive during deflict stiutions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br>First i believe <span style="color:orange">they wouldnt know when to stop</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  because they might be road block and they wouldnt be able to identify the objects. <span style="color:orange">Examples from the passage are, the cars will probably have a hard time navigating through work zones and around accidents. The cars will also have to deal with complicated traffic issues , such as navigating through roadworks or roadblocks that lie ahead for the autonomous car.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Second reason is, <span style="color:orange">they might go out of control</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The car might face some technical deflicties and someone will most likely get injured. If some dies get injured who will be at fault? wil it be the driver or the manufacturer. I believe it will be the manufacturer because they made the car and they didnt make sure if it was safe for the people to drive arounfd in or not.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>My last reason is <span style="color:orange">They wouldnt be as surportive during deflict stiutions</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">i think They wouldnt be very surportive because the car might not know what to do. For example, if there was roadblock and the car didnt or couldnt indenify them and the car crushes. What if the car was told to go somewhere and went to wrong way? will it be the cars fault. And if the car got broken down for no reason during traffic will it be okay for other people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>In conclusion i believ that driverless cars wont be as safe as cars driven by humans. i believe this because <span style="color:orange">they wouldnt know when to stop</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">they might go out of control</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , and <span style="color:orange">they wouldnt be very surportive during deflict stiutions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>
