Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:white">Changing the school policy to only letting students attend or play sports is good but bad at the same time</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.304970596</span>,0.6877523240000001,0.0072771037999999]</span> , <span style="color:orange">it can be good because you should keep up with your school work while your playing sports or other activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0716644549999999,<span style="color:white">0.905148972</span>,0.0231865565]</span>  <span style="color:white">That is the main reason why you are going to school. If you cannot somehow keep up with any of your school work and your getting D' s and F' s then you shouldn't be playing any sports or be in any activities for the week or that period of time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.399913426</span>,0.59240574,0.00768083168]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But having as C average and not being able to play sports i think is unreasonable. So having that policy is a good thing. But it can be bad at a certain point because having to have at least a B average is kind of high</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.239690894,<span style="color:white">0.744990706</span>,0.0153184239599999]</span> . <span style="color:white">I think at least having a C average is pretty reasonable than having to have a B average. If the policy was having to have at least a B average to play any sports or other activities i wouldn't join any of them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.394599216</span>,0.5976012820000001,0.0077994892]</span>
