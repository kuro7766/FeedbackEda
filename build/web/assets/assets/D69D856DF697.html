The goverenment is very indiffernt and keeps lots of secrets from the citizens in this country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.68286835</span>,0.31513777,0.00199389278]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I can sit here all day and tell you if i agree with this whole Electoral college, but it's irrelavant to me</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.562749924</span>,0.435900536,0.00134951554]</span> . <span style="color:white">I'm not saying that i hate this country, but there are alot of things that I disagree with.
