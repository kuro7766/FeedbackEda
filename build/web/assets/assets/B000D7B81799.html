Dear John Kerry, the senator for the state of Florida <span style="color:orange">we must keep The Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.104848465,<span style="color:white">0.86898959</span>,0.0261619316]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Why do we need to keep it? we need to keep it because it is an important process that our founding fathers created, that is part of our constitution.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.063791924,<span style="color:white">0.85997646</span>,0.0762316336]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Also, it was established as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.1155163969999999,0.8375004580000001,<span style="color:white">0.046983145</span>]</span>  <span style="color:white">The electoral college process deals with peoples selections of the electors. It consists of 538 electors and their has to 270 votes to elect the president. We have a president and vice president without having the electoral college, it would be useless to have all these senators.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.7499793539999999</span>,0.24735066,0.0026699921999999]</span>  <span style="color:white">We have a house of representatives that work extremely hard and it would be rude to get rid of the electoral college and changing elections by popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.6293233239999999</span>,0.3680936959999999,0.00258298378]</span>  <span style="color:white">Leave everything the way its going because the process works awesome and if you mess something up your going to lose your job being the state senator, or your going to get many letters, emails, possibly phone calls of hatred and more. That will not be good for you or your business so my suggestion as a citizen is to not make any changes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.432480256</span>,0.542149884,0.0253698515]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Once a statement or rule is in the constitution you cant just take it away or change it that will ruin everything. I mean... its your decision on what you want to do but if I were you I would listen to my opinion strongly.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.7603032160000002,<span style="color:white">0.2377328959999999</span>,0.001963890784]</span>  Well that is all I have to say so keep the electoral college and good luck.
