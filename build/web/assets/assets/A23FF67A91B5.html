Dear Senator, t<span style="color:orange">he election is coming up soon and so is voting. The Electoral College and the popular vote get to select the president of the United States every year. I want this year to be a little different</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">This year I would like to see only the Electoral College vote for the president</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The Electoral College knows all about thinking if the president is good enough for the country, and if he can be a good role model, or also a commander in chief. That is the reason why I would like to keep the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> .</br></br>I would like the country to keep the Electoral College because they make good desiciosns, know if the candidate person is the right president, and last but not least they might think if the citizens would like this president based on his promises that he would like to keep. <span style="color:orange">For example there are two candidates fighting to be president and it's time to vote and the Electoral College might look over  to see if the president looks like he can keep his promise to keep the coutnry safe, to make this a better country or not . That's what they look for in a president. That's the reason wwhy we should keep the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">When the citizens want to vote for the president as well, they think of the same thing, if he's good enough for our country, and if he is going to keep us safe. The Electoral College knows a lot about picking the right president and they've been doing it for a long time</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">"The Electoral College consits of 538 electors and a  majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. That's enough electors to vote wether or not the president should be this person or that person</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> .
