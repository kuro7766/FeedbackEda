Dear state senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that they should change the election way of how they are doing it. I think that the president should be chosen by the most popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  i aslo think <span style="color:white">that they shouldnt do the voting thing if they are gunna end up chooseing it them selfes. in the passage it said that, the electoral college is made up of 538 electors and only the majority vote is 270.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  So <span style="color:orange">i dont understand why they thousand of people to vote if their vote doesnt really mater its what senators choose overall.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">i think it would be fair if what the peple choose the most shall win. What if one of them gets more votes and the senator picks the other because they had more votes in there group, thats not fair. i just think that the overall vote of the people should count, and not make them wast there time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  it also says in the article <span style="color:orange">when you vote for you candidate you actuall voting for the candidates elector, so they are trying to trick them into thinking that there votw would count.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">what if the persident that the senator choose didnt know how to work stuff and had bad disitions, the election is every four years on a tuesday on a november. thats a pretty long time if you ask me. I think that half of the people votes dont cont cause of the sentors that choose</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">i know it would be long to count everones vote</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">but i dont think it matters because in the end it would be chosen by the people that wanted that president not what the senators wanted.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span>
