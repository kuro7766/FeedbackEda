Dear principal, <span style="color:orange">I don't think students of any school should have to do community service if they don't want to.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Community service takes a lot out of the day.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">What if the students other things to do at home.</br></br>Most students at our school play sports after school, and if they are playing spots how are they going to do community service?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I know it is great to help out the community,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but we should be able to do it when we want to.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I understand that if a student have to have some kind of punishment and have to community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">But I don't think we should have to pick up after other students they should pick up after themselves.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">What time does all of this starts? Because some students have to be at home at a certain time. And if we had to do it after we got home from playing sports it would be too dark to see how to do anything.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I know it is great to help your to but I really don't should have to do communit</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
