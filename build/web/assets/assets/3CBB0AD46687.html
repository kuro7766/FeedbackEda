Also voters can't always control who the electors vote for either which also make this system very unfair. The fact that winner takes all is the system we use is very unfair to the voter because it doesn't really show true votes only overall votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Although voting for your candidates electors seems easy you can't always trust other people to do the things they are supposed to you can only trust yourself.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When you vote for the President you should be directly voting for him or her not voting for an electoral slate.
