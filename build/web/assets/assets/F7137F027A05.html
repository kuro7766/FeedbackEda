<span style="color:orange">The first time NASA first spotted the Face on Mars was in 1976 during the Viking 1 mission. At first the scientists back at NASA were surprised, but it did not last long. After some research was done scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. What made the mesa look like a face were just shadows. When the image was revealed to the public it got a lot of attention. Although some believed the face was a sign of alien life, others were not as easily convinced.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0532504986,<span style="color:white">0.75385676</span>,0.1928927519999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The first picture was taken in 1976 when technology was not very great</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0980638162,<span style="color:white">0.853928284</span>,0.0480078952]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So in 1997</br></br>NASA 's Mars Exploration Program chief scientist, Jim Garvin decided he'd try to get another photo.

The article also mentions that each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photos.
