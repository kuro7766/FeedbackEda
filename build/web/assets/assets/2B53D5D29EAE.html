Dear Mr. Principal</br></br><span style="color:white">The idea of making school policy that you have to have at least a grade average of a B is a good idea, but you would have more of your star players ineligible to play because of grades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Now if our school was known for its brains and not sports, then yes i would encourage this but it's not. We are known for our sports winning state championships in all of the sports we offer. Changing the eligibility level to having at least a B or better, could possible shoot down every thing our school is known for and why people want to come to it</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  and those who don't fear us in an athletic category. <span style="color:orange">I believe though if you must make this a rule, then you have to get the ones who aren't as smart tutors or someone to help them get the grades to play their sport.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">For other activities the I can see where having an eligibility grade of at least a B could be a good thing like ski club, that's something that you can do by yourself bu the school provid</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>In conclusion <span style="color:orange">I believe that it could be a good idea if our school was known for its grades but because it's just the opposite, we need to keep the eligibility level at a C average to maintain our reputation to those outside of school and those who may be thinking of coming to our school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
