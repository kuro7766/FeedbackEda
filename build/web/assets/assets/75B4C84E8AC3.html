Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that students of SCHOOL_NAME should be aloud to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times, just as long as the phones are turned off during class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.036518258,<span style="color:white">0.932879242</span>,0.030602469]</span> </br></br>I strongly agree with this subject. <span style="color:orange">Teens in our school are getting in trouble almost everyday because they are getting their phones taken away from them in lunch and breaks in between classes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0668934512,<span style="color:white">0.91630263</span>,0.0168039308]</span>  <span style="color:white">Then there are some students who don't really get what "No phones in class" means.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.357280766</span>,0.639963024,0.0027562403599999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that you should make it so we can have our phones out during lunch and between classes</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0750527028,<span style="color:white">0.91571522</span>,0.00923208046]</span> , <span style="color:orange">because sometimes it maybe an emergency and we need to call our parents about something that we don't want to talk about in the office phone were everyone can hear what your saying around you.
