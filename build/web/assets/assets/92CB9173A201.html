<span style="color:yellow">In 1976 NASA released a photo of a landform on Mars resembling a human face. Not everyone was easily convinced that it was only just a landmass though. Conspiracy theorists believed that it was, "Bona fide evidence of life on Mars." In the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars," the author, Garvin, believed that it was only a mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.00438074282,0.217980556,<span style="color:white">0.777638688</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I agree with Garvin that this landmass was not an alien or proof of aliens whatsoever.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0098656584,<span style="color:white">0.38411362</span>,0.6060207160000001]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">There is a large amount of proof in the article that was confirmed by NASA that this face is only a landmass, nothing more.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00479041998,0.243988384,<span style="color:white">0.7512211799999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">In paragraph two of the article the author claimed that mesa's were ordinary in Cydonia, area the mesa was located, according to scientists. The only difference between this mesa and other mesa's found on Mars is that it had uncommon shadows over it illustrating eyes and a mouth. Since mesa's are common in this area it is very unlikely that this, "face," was anything different than just an average mesa taken at an odd angle with a low quality camera.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0031592324,0.160672809,<span style="color:white">0.8361679280000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The author also stated in paragraph seven that in 1998 that the photo was retaken with a higher quality camera.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0077847789799999,0.3201763039999999,<span style="color:white">0.6720389</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">NASA released the photo onto a JPL website once the photo was confirmed and the only thing found was not an alien monument, but a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0136222186,<span style="color:white">0.400014936</span>,0.58636284]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Many people still doubted that it was a mesa after this photo due to wispy clouds bluring the picture of the monument.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.014603557,<span style="color:white">0.4283769279999999</span>,0.557019478]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">According to paragraph ten in the article, the picture was taken one last time of the landmass revealing the same thing, an average mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Effective/0.009254126,0.343144766,<span style="color:white">0.647601122</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Mesa's also are found commonly in the american west as said in paragraph eleven.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00914551156,0.346009322,<span style="color:white">0.6448451719999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The mesa resembles the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho.

The belief that the mesa is actually a face is inncorect due to evidence in the article and my essay. Mesa's are common in the area the picture was taken and the face was caused by shadows along with a low quality camera. Whichever side you are on I believe I have brought forth enough evidence to change your opinion or strengthen your opionion that there was no alien lifeforms yet found on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.00579024132,0.218990288,<span style="color:white">0.775219516</span>]</span>
