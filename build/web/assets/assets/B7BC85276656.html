Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I think community service is a very important requirement to have in schools. We all live in a community, so we all need to work as a community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Where would we be if people didn't help each other out?</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If we didn't take the time to do something for the ones around us? No where. We would all still be living in caves! community service has helped us all at some point. even if it doesn't have to-do directly with ourselves, like cleaning the trash out for parks or giving clothes and other necessities to Goodwill or The Salvation Army.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Lending a hand in some way would teach kids life lessons we would carry with us for the rest of our lives</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Spending time in the community just a few times a month would teach hard work, how to work well with others, and how in order to be able to take you have to give back. Also how to accept differences, because everyone you meet wont be the same as you are, or think the same as you might.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">I understand many students are not open to this idea or don't want to work out side of school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Extra credit could be offered as a way to help motivate students</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">An extra point couldvery hour spend working in the community. high school credits could be given. maybe you could choose how much time a month you would spend doing community service. there could be a group service project so you could work with friends to make it seem like fun!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Community service is necessary in our world to be able to perform and have the things that we do. it teaches life lessons that might help in a job search later in life. that is why in my opinion there should be a community service requirement at our school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
