You'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."(qoute form source 2) Those 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry may not win the statewide election. The voters also are not always able to control who there electors vote for. "Legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people." (qoute form source 2). So there a chance they may change there mind and the president they wished to win may not win because the legislatures do not have to vote in there favor. In some case seventeen states didn't even see the candidates at all. Some states including Rhode Island and South Carolina, "and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.004145024106,0.1010335705999999,<span style="color:white">0.8948213600000001</span>]</span>  Also another reason why we should remove the Electoral Colleges is for the reason that voters may become confuse and vote for the wrong person.</br></br>Futhermore we should remove the Electors Colleges, because its unfair to the voters. <span style="color:yellow">For example the winner takes all system in each state.
