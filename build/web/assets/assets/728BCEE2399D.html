Dear, Mr. Principal</br></br><span style="color:orange">I say that students should not be required to perform community service but make it like a extra credit thing to earn extra credits.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also I think that community service is a good thing for our community and everyone who lives in our community,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but we should not be required, because a lot of people would probably drop out of school if we were required to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">But you could make a volunteer community clean up club for our school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It can help senior citizens and young children and people with disabilities.</br></br>It also could clean up some community parks or playgrounds.</br></br>But mostly I would just stick on making a club for volunteers.</br></br>That's some of my reasons for not making community service a required activity to pass school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also there are a lot of students already in extra activities</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">like band, or sports or both or even other, so that could be very bad for those students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">But sometimes it's good for them and our community, well its always good for our community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Sincerely, your students
