<span style="color:white">The author does a pretty nice job at explaining all the dangers of Venus. The author provides the readers with all the information that is necessary, for the space program. Although Venus is dangerous, scientists are still willing to find out about it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The world today revoles mainly around science, and scientists will do what they have to do to get information. "Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landinf for more than a few hours" (paragraph 2).</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">In the quote just stated, it proves that even if the spacecraft does not last more than a few hours, scientists are spending thousands of dollars on equipment just for some information but not much.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">In the next quote, some of the features will be listed. "The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters" (paragraph 4). Astonomers are working with everything they can at the moment. "Researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks" (paragraph 6).</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">The previous quote is stating that scientists are trying no matter what the risks are. Also, scientists cannot completely risk their lives for safety purposes but they do their best.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Scientists will strive to meet the challenges by Venus. It is believed that information should not be limited but risks should. If none of the scientists took risks for our planet, there would be no information about the past, present, or future. Scientists work and risk the dangers of</br></br>Venus. Scientists will do what they have to, to support their claims.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
