This natural landform is known as a mesa,which you may have heard of before. The point is,these types of things happening on this planet is very common.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0508558722,<span style="color:white">0.7736616940000001</span>,0.175482421]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe myself that it is just a natural landform beacuse I know that we do not have enough evidence to prove that it was anything else. I also believe it is just a natural landform/mesa because I know these things are common on this planet. So don't just going around telling people aliens exist before you get the actual facts. If there were further eveidence leading to make us believe there were aliens it would be fine. We just don't have that extra information or evidence. I hope I finally lead some of you to believe the truth that the Face is just a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0518535412,<span style="color:white">0.784029004</span>,0.164117466]</span>
