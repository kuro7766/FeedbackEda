Also,even though The Face on Mars, is on Mars it deosnt mean that natural Earth things can't happen there either. Garvin also states, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River PLain of Idaho,".</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.188456168,<span style="color:white">0.7939207319999999</span>,0.0176231048]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">According to paragraph 8 and 7 not everyone was satisifed with the pictures that the MOC team snapped that were 10 times sharper than the original Vikings photo.

Even though most people may argue over what it really is or who made it, there is enough information to prove that it is a natural landform. According to Garvin, people need to use the rule of thumb, and he believes that its the size of a natural landfrom, and some people say it was covered by an alien haze or it just could have been because of the cloudy weather.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.033091164,<span style="color:white">0.8617145299999999</span>,0.105194303]</span>
