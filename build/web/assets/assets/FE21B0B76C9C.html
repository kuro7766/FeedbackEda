Some of the times a friend my not know what` s best for you. And I say if you think that it would make a difference in one persons life then it was all worth it. And no matter what every person wants to live in a safe and also clean place no matter were you may go.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.0845579729999999,<span style="color:white">0.8184645199999998</span>,0.0969775304]</span>  And <span style="color:orange">I think that if the principle would require them to do it then that is not fare on the principles side.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.226876824,<span style="color:white">0.757250346</span>,0.0158728378]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Most kids loves getting involved in doing things for their community.</br></br>I think that for all the friends that think that it takes up to much time you should just try to work something out like a real friend would. No one sad that you had to work all day it doesn't matter if you only do the community service for five minutes at least you can say i did something to help out my school and my community. Not to may people can actually say that they helped make a difference in their whole community.
