If it is from that television is not always right. Especially when it comes to safety. Safety is nouthing to play around with or to toy with. It is a prevention of lot lives and or injeries.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.408446662</span>,0.585569208,0.00598413134]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The human driver should have their hands, plure on the weel at all times unless thay have finished there driveing route to their destination. Again for the positive the idea for a camera feed from the rearveiw mirror should be in place for driveing and more so parking help. Anouther and lastly for the positive side, the 3-D model of the car's surroundings. It should be there for better and less reckless driveing.

Parts from the car can be used to help us with our own driveing to prevent a reck. In a sertain situation being it a huge rode blocking or little bump into a parked car. pedestrians could be prevented from harm as well. As I have finished my conclution I shall leave you with this. Would you want to keep youre life from the parts of the cars, or lost from a self driveing car gone out of controll or messed up from bad construction/matinance?</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1291722699999999,<span style="color:white">0.8246310000000001</span>,0.0461967192]</span>
