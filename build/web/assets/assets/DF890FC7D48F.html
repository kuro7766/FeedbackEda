They wouldnt have to participate in a sport or club that they dont want to but they would have to pick something. Everyone would have at least one friend because they have to work with each other all the time and they would learn to like each other. The whole school would be productive all the time and the schools systems would be improving every day.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1032000762,<span style="color:white">0.786224328</span>,0.1105755829999999]</span> </br></br>The students would be focused on getting good grades because if they dont then they have to leave their club or team and pick a different team or club. <span style="color:orange">Students would like what they do because they chose it and because they like it so much they will have better attitudes and behave better. Students wanna have good grades and be happy and this is the perfect way to make it happen. The more they experience in that club or team the happier the students are gonna be inside and outside of school. Some students are depressed and sad all the time so if we give those students people to hang out with and fun things to do we can wipe out all of the depression that those students have.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0641991988,<span style="color:white">0.732621292</span>,0.2031794974]</span> </br></br>If the principle made this a rule than students would have more time to socialize with other students and their teachers. The more socializing that the students have with teachers the more the students will respect the teachers and have a better attitude in their class. <span style="color:orange">If the students know and respect their teacherÂ than they wont act up during class time and the class will be able to get more stuff done. If the students stop messing around in a teachers class than the teachers would respect them and the class could work hard to learn more everyday.

I agree with this principle in many ways and think he is absolutely amazing and his idea is a great one.
