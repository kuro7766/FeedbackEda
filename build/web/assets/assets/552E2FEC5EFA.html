Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think the United States of America should change or abolish the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0659653776,<span style="color:white">0.830381228</span>,0.103653407]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because sometimes it is not actually what the people want.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0976380124,<span style="color:white">0.8450053760000001</span>,0.0573565944]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In the 2000 Election Al Gore won the popular vote meaning more people in the USA wanted him at President than the winner. Should'nt we give the people what they want? A poll states thart over 60% of United States voters want to change or get rid of the Electoral College for this exact reason. The state sends people to represent the State not to represent the people. The state or people in office could totally defy whatever the people want in that state.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.133419364,<span style="color:white">0.7316907840000001</span>,0.134889828]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Lets say there is a tie. Then every state would have only 1 vote meaning the little state of Delaware would have as much say as the huge state of California. This example is the complete opposite of doing what the people want.This means the 35 million people have as much say as the 500,000 or sol in Delaware.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.177430856,<span style="color:white">0.7601587879999999</span>,0.0624103455999999]</span>  <span style="color:white">Our government bases off what the people want but the Electoral College dosen't always base off what the people more than what the state wants itself.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1430954851999999</span>,0.7747586200000001,0.0821458892]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Each party representing the state selects the "trusted" people for each state</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.4389181139999999,<span style="color:white">0.548649692</span>,0.0124321922]</span> . <span style="color:orange">What if those people have a change of heart and they decide to change towards something the state dosen't want.

Would either the Democrats or Republicans really be elected or would it just be 270 people in the room just be deciding whatever they want?</br></br>Sincerly,</br></br>PROPER_NAME
