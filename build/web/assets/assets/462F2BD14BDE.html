Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Do you really think the electoral college should stay? The second source states that Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Does that make any sence to you? That even though the majority votes on one thing but they dont get that in a democracy?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college is just a waste of time</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Why would i want to do what the second source says and vote for a guy to vote for who i want to vote for</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> ? Reald that sentence again. Makes absolutely no sence.</br></br><span style="color:orange">The only part that makes sence is that no matter how large of an area or the bias of an area, the electoral college can not be bias</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:white">I think we should not have the electoral college. Mostly because i dont think i want to learn about swing states and run off elections and stuff.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Thanks for the consideration,</br></br>PROPER_NAME
