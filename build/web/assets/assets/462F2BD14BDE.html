Does that make any sence to you? That even though the majority votes on one thing but they dont get that in a democracy?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.1015166228,<span style="color:white">0.809401802</span>,0.0890815804]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college is just a waste of time</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.126444256,<span style="color:white">0.8546648040000001</span>,0.0188909676]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Why would i want to do what the second source says and vote for a guy to vote for who i want to vote for</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.522948212,<span style="color:white">0.4715261519999999</span>,0.00552560734]</span> ?
