<span style="color:orange">My opinion on driverless cars is that it is a good development.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It can drive for you while you are texting or something so that wouldn't be a problem or not. Also it will have cameras on you to see what is happening in the car as well as out of it. I think it will be more usefull while on long drives and what not.</br></br>It alerts you if there is a problem so even if you are distracted by a phone call or something you will be alerted. But i think there should be more tests done on the driverless car such as braking, accelerating, steering, and turn signals. It will have 3-D ssensors outside the car so just in case a animal runs in front of the car it will brake automatically which i think is a good feature.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Driverless cars will come either now or later so we should all accept it and consider it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">People will not like the idea but they probably haven't tried it out either so they have no real argument as to why this is a bad idea.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This is my opinion on driverless cars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
