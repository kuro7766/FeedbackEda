<span style="color:yellow">To start off, the electoral college is a system thats been around for ever but is getting outdated. I think that some people might want a different system while others prefer the same or dont care. For all we know,Bob Dole could be right about abolishing the electoral college. Or maybe it needs a new way of carrying the votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span>  Me, <span style="color:orange">I think we should get a new system as well</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> , but heres why.</br></br><span style="color:white">Time has nothing to do with this way of voting, nothing at all. But maybe we should see some changes in the way we elect a president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">60% of people would prefer that a direct election be held.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Others are probably lazy or cant make it if one was held, and thats why they prefer the system were using now. But problems are starting to surface with this, already outdated system.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The very first problem already is the fact that they vote for the slate of electors and not to vote for just the president. Then the fact that you vote for 1 out of 34 democratic electors. If that one that you chose won the statewise election they would get the plethora of votes that were earned. All this locomotion instead of just voting for the people that you want to lead the whole country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If we were to vote for just the president and vice president of the state and whomever else we vote for, less problems would be seen.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">More factors are that the state legislatures are basically responsible for choosing the electors. This is a very unfair factor because they choose people who oppose a candidate. If that happens, the popular votes dont transfer to that specific candidate. Also sometimes the electors refuse to vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This system is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system that occurs.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college may have been around for a long time, but is getting old. The systems it uses are irrational. Its methods are outdated and bias. There is not much reason for it. We need a new system.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>         Â
