NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, soon we will know what they are talking about. Soon NASA will be able to get more information on Venus and if it is ready for living objects to come and live on it and if not then NASA can find another planet and study that one for a couple of years and see if that one is live able.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.556573492,<span style="color:white">0.441442212</span>,0.0019843192099999]</span>
