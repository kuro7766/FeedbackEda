<span style="color:orange">Why would you think the Face was created by aliens? When photographers take pictures of Mars, you never see an alien in the photos. There may be research going on to find alien life, but so far, NASA hasn't found any. Therefore, it couldn't have been created by aliens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0438738544,<span style="color:white">0.673114972</span>,0.28301116]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Scientists have credible information that shows people it is just a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0290033766,<span style="color:white">0.7245690340000001</span>,0.24642758]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">First of all, if NASA thought an alien created the Face they would already be researching it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.076859926,<span style="color:white">0.73281354</span>,0.190326542]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Afterall, scientists automatically assumed that it was a Martian mesa.

Michael Malin took pictures of Mars that were ten times sharper than the original. The new and improved photos showed everyone that the Face, in fact, was a natural landform. There wasn't any evidence that could tell us it was an alien monument.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0295047383999999,<span style="color:white">0.6662456080000001</span>,0.3042496419999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Of course, people still weren't satisfied.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.146637322,<span style="color:white">0.7799064139999999</span>,0.0734563002]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Once again, Michael Malin goes back and takes photos in an even higher resolution.

He goes on to say these types of landforms are common on Earth, mainly in the American West.
