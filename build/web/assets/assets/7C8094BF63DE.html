Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe that voting for the President of the United States should be based on the present idea of the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0276845421999999,<span style="color:white">0.60278111</span>,0.369534356]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There are many elements that play into the reasoning for this. The Electoral College is a process developed by the makers of the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of 538 electors with each state holding a certain amout of these electors based on the population of that state. Candidates try to gain the vote of electors focusing on larger states with more electors</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.311579858,<span style="color:white">0.566604136</span>,0.1218160114]</span> . <span style="color:orange">It was something created by the makers and founding fathers of the Constitution and something so important should not be changed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0682023548,<span style="color:white">0.628217376</span>,0.3035802769999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Presidential candidates focus on gaining the majority vote of large states in order to obtain more electors. A large state such as California containing over 35 million voters should have as much of a say in electing a president as a small state like Wyoming only containing 500,000 voters. The Electoral College makes sure that the "majority" of voters doesn't decide an election and everyone has a say. The "winner takes all" system evens out the playing field for all those little states who want just as much of a say in determining a new president as a large one does.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0703092806,<span style="color:white">0.564649372</span>,0.36504137]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The idea of a Electoral College adds a sense of competition persuading a candidate to influence states with a high number of electoral votes making the race for interesting.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0720710181999999,0.57571431,<span style="color:white">0.3522146659999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Swing states are a huge deal in this process for they mainly decide the election with the ability to change an election in a heartbeat.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.295154132,<span style="color:white">0.653417224</span>,0.0514286344]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If a majority voting system was incorporated into the election system instead of the Electoral College the process would become much more complicated than it already is.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0806212104,<span style="color:white">0.663030114</span>,0.25634868]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Voters should be able to vote not just for a new president but for a slate of electors who aid in electing the president..
