<span style="color:orange">Is the Facial Action coding system a good idea to put it in the student classroom?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think not,its not a good idea to mein 2 ways.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">One is because the kids might not want you to know how they feel. My second one is becuase what if a kid gets picked to be mad or sad and he gets into a fit and he gets super ticked off becuase he didn't want anyone to know. The last one is becuase that weird to be checking for the kids emotions. The first two are both similar and the third one is just plain obvious.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Yes it might work in classes like drama club, Happy day club or other clubs but other than that i dont think sobecuasei in just a regular classroom it would be weird as i say</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">I beleive it could also maybe work for sports but other than that i dont agree that we should have thoese emotion reader system in our classrooms. people might not want to get recognized as mad,sad,happy or even just plain or tired.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Another last reason why i dont beiieve it should be in the classrooms because just as i said in the other paragraph that peoplemight notlike it or might now want people to know how they feel becuase it might be personal.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">It is personal and its crossing the line. Soem people might get into a fit and that wont look pretty.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclution,i disagree that we should put the Facial Action Coding System in the classrooms because it wouldn't look good in the classrooms for students nor parents.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
