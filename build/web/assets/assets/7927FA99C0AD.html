An example would be:</br></br>Back in 1960. segregationalists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in relpacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)</br></br>-source 2, second paragraph.</br></br>This is stating that in 1960 people who opposed Kennedy nearly became his electors. So if they succeeded in becoming his electors his votes would have gone to another opposing candidate. This could not happen with a system of voting that directly conected everyones votes with congress. This was a clear case of sabotage in the election of 1960.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0418500098,<span style="color:white">0.368623371</span>,0.589526628]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Votes in larger states and smaller states are balanced out so the number of votes would not be based on the number of people in the states.
