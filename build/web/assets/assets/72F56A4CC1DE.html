Dear State Senator,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I am writing this letter to you today to talk to you about Electoral College and election by popular vote. I feel very strongly on this topic as it is something I  know I  will come in contact with when i have the right to vote in the near future.</br></br>As we look back to the very day the Constitution was written, it has been a comprise that between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizen that fifve hundred and thirty eight electorshave a meeting for they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress, as stated by the Office of the Federal Register.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.3489629488,0.515875004,<span style="color:white">0.135162063</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I strongly feel that we should change from Electoral College to election by popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0444346812,<span style="color:white">0.837829514</span>,0.1177358152]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The reason I am saying this is because, it allows voters to equally vote for their rightful choice of president in that they feel best about having rule over the country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0569001389999999,<span style="color:white">0.7950734580000001</span>,0.148026412]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Why is populary voting a better choice may many ask, popular voting is a better choice because it allows voters to have fair chance of having their choice of President, become Presidnt.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.314245636</span>,0.67358467,0.0121697154]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In the eyes of some, one in particular being Richard A. Posner, Electoral College may be good for a few reasons, those reasons being, Certainty of Outcome, Everyone's President, Swing States, Big States, and avoid Run-Off Elections</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.1008689522,<span style="color:white">0.8017993320000001</span>,0.0973317076]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but, in the eyes of others, it may seem "Unfair, outdated and irrational." Says Bradford Plumer.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.1546555192,<span style="color:white">0.7959348879999999</span>,0.0494095858]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In some cases, Electoral College may be an easier way to go for, the desired President to get elected but, not exactly the fairest way either. I believe that everyone should have a fair chance at voting and waiting for the out come equally with everyone and thats why I believe be we should change to election by popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0767001678,<span style="color:white">0.7943680320000001</span>,0.128931789]</span> </br></br>Thank you.
