Students spend seven through 8 hours a day at school. Should be getting at least eight hours of sleep. This is leaving on eights hours to do homework, chores, ride or walk home, and spend time with family. If you add an extra activity this will take away from time at home. Some of the activities are fished late at night or are held in a place far away so it will take awhile to get home. This makes doing homework hard or even sleeping hard. If a student comes to school sleep it will make the work that they are doing decrease. When this happens the grades will drop slowly but surely. When they see that there grade has dropped this makes them upset and stressed.

Students should be able to chose what they want to do. If they can handle doing extracurricular activates then they can, it shouldn't be a must.
