Dear: Principal</br></br><span style="color:orange">I am arguing against the policy change</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">even though there are some children out there that really needs help with their academic work</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">that does not mean that only because they have a c average that would not let them enjoy their sports or other activities unless they've a B average.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Sometimes teachers or even principal needs to consider that we should give the help that any student should have</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . Also this may <span style="color:orange">consider student self as steam. Meaning student would start to feel sad nervous, and not wanting to go to school</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because of the reason they have a low averages and they can not participate in other activities or sports. The fact that there are children that would want to enjoy many good things the school is actually giving it to them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">We would want to make changes as, "like to be a better person for a better tomorrow" This supports the idea of having have many good thoughts and incasing your work as much as possible.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  In some situation like arguing <span style="color:orange">we should make a vote to see if kids would want to have a school policy of change and having to participate in fun activities but they first need to have at least a B average.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  Some reasons I would be against the school policy change is because <span style="color:white">you would feel ashame and then many bad things could happen meaning, you would be angry etc.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  In additionally , <span style="color:orange">I think that student should have sports</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">it helps them with their health, and problems that they would have personal.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I am against this policy change.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>Student.
