Why would we keep this?</br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electorial College is a way to choose the Presidential canidate who wins the election. It involves a slate of electors (according to Source 2) who cast their votes in. The people in each state vote for the winning electors of that state. The electors pledge to a canidate and thats what people vote for. Once the people choose a winning elector group they go to Congress and cast their votes in for who they want, and that person then gets so many votes</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1420566838,<span style="color:white">0.5110682000000001</span>,0.3468751529999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The problem is that the electors aren't required to vote for who they said they would, so if the elector suddenly decided to change his mind after he or she won, the people's votes are basically invalidated and a different elector gets the votes</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0121725943399999,<span style="color:white">0.28502197</span>,0.702805428]</span> . <span style="color:orange">This effectively removes the people from the equation in who gets elected. All an elector would have to do is win over the people, then he or she could just change their minds and cast a different vote than what they said they were going to do.

It has the potential to allow the electors to defy the will of the people who voted them in, invalidating the people's votes and making them pointless. It also has candates only focusing their ads and visits on the states with more votes and the states biased towards their party. Finally, it has almost all the states have a landslide "winner-takes_all" style of awarding electorial votes. This means if one side of electors only wins by a slim margin, the other side gets nothing, even though since they lost by a small number they clearly have a sizeable amount of voters for them. The Electorial College needs to be removed before someone takes advantage of it's serious flaws and takes the votes of the people and makes them useless.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.00665421064,0.2075437744,<span style="color:white">0.785802008</span>]</span>
