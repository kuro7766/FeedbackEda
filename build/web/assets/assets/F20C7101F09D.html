<span style="color:orange">In the three stories, What is the electoral college?, The Indefensible Electoral College, and the Defense of Electoral College, each argue wether or not to keep or over throw the electoral Colloge.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The Electoral college has been a crutial part of voting who stays or leaves the offic chair of america, But one thing for sure losing this way of voting is very questionable.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In the story, In defense of Electoral college, it eplains five very detailed reasons to keep the electoral college. The certainty of the outcome of this voting system has been accepted for years.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Richard A. Posner explains, "The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exeeds his share of popular vote."This quote given to us shows the certain possibility of who wins the share of the presidents seat. Each vote by the citizens of America is sent to chose the "qualified citizens" to represent their state in th election for president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The person in the election for president also has to have a appeal to many regions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If the candidate is attempting to gain more votes by stayong in the same region he or she will not gain more electoral votes. When a person runs for president is they go into many regions to pursuade more people to vote on that person for president then they will gain more electoral votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The system does have a few errors in its existence. When people are voting someone to represent them they might make a mistake on wich candidate thier voting on. If people did have a direct vote for who becomes president then they have their exact opinion on who becomes president,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">but the system of voting still stands because most people in America like this way of voting better.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It would be better to have people representing each state with electoral votes because having every vote from every citizen of america sent to an individual slot for who should be president is overwhelming</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">instead, we have a system where each person votes on a candidate to represent their state in the election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  It is a better way of using time wisely in voting for America's new president.</br></br><span style="color:orange">To close, Having the Electoral College system to vote is a fantastic way of showing who should be president for America. The Electoral College  should stay because of the certainty of who will be next president and avoiding the run-off elections to prevent uncertainty of who will be president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
