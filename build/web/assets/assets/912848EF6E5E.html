<span style="color:white">Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus is the closest planet to Earth In the terms of the density and size, and on distance too, but each previos mission was unmanned, no spcaecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. It's been three decades since a spaceship has touched down on Venus, Is a challenging planet for the humans to study even despite of the proximity to us. Also, there's a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets on Venus, but what's more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the Venus atmosphere.</br></br>The temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and also the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what is on planet Earth, the conditions are far more extreme than anything we humans encounter on Earth. Even if Mercury is closer to the sun, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet on the solar sytem and it also presents additional impedimentslike powerful earthquakes, erupting volcanoes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.679658212</span>,0.3125508019999999,0.00779096576]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">If the scientists know everything about this why are they discussing about visiting Venus if it isn't a good place where we humans could be and live at, because we wouldn't even be able to live for a day just as the spacecraft that didn't even survided just only for a few hours.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.577701234</span>,0.41940758,0.002891174992]</span>  <span style="color:white">Probably long ago just as it says on paragraph 4 that, Venus was maybe covered largely with oceans and it could have supported various forms of life just like here on Earth and Venus then also has some features that are analogous to Earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.453797198</span>,0.5436768280000001,0.0025259777]</span>  <span style="color:white">It's better to keep studying Venus then to just go visit it, because there would probably be stuff on Venus that the scientist don't even know about and then the people that would go visit Venus would be in such danger.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.5033848379999999</span>,0.4938140179999999,0.0028011398739999]</span>  <span style="color:white">In conlusion, scientist should still be doing research about Venus, because everything they have known recently about Venus it sounds really dangerous just to go and see it on their own then they would put their lifes in danger, and I don't think that's what they want</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.37938836</span>,0.617668686,0.00294294268]</span>  so <span style="color:white">It's better to keep doing more research about it instead of just going without knowing everything about the planet.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.433267374</span>,0.564290372,0.002442253472]</span>
