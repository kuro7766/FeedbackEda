<span style="color:orange">As a kid in school I do not think distance learning will benefit students,</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">they will get off of task very easily,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">they won't have as many responsibility's,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">their minds will not be on school work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Distance learning has some pros with it but it has more cons. In the end i do not believe it will benefit the students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">When I am in school and a teacher starts to lecture, I start to thinking or even go to sleep.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">By doing distance learning you as a student will not get to handle hands on stuff or go with then anywhere they go.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It would have to be hard to sit around and look at computer screen</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I know school can be not so fun and boring</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  but <span style="color:orange">I would rather be around friends, than by myself.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">When you are going to school you have responsibility's.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Having taken distance learning you could get up when ever you would like, you could loose all your responsibilities.</br></br>For example, you have to get up on time, take a shower, change your clothes and be at school on time. Taken care of your self is a big thing. When it comes time for a job and you have to be at work at 8:30 then you need to be ready so you can make it in on time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If a student was to do the distance learning they will be cut short from after school actives.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For example, if you wish to play a sport you have to be at your home school for at least three classes. Taken a sport away from a kid is a bad idea. By taken sports away from kids can lead kids to go down the wrong road.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">With all of that being said I do not think the long distance will benefit kids. They will be lost, messed up, and mad. Kids learn people skills in school. Kids learn public speaking skills in school. Kids learn how to deal with responsibilities for them selves. School needs kids as well as kids need school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
