Some people just want to keep their emotions to themselves so that others can't see or know them. This could become a privacy issue when it comes to how people use this device. They could use it on people that don't want them to know what they're feeling.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">This device could become useful to see how people felt in movies, books, or even paintings.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I don't think that humans should use it on other humans unless they had permission to do so. When people hear about this device they may think that it isn't worth it, but it could be useful when it comes to things that happened long ago. Seeing other peoples emotions can be harmful to them unless they allowed you to do so. A lot of people want to hide their emotions and keep them to themselves. Emotions are something that can be shared or they can be kept away inside somebody. They can tell people or they can hide it, either way its up to them. This is why this device isn't helpful to the world.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Again it may be helpful with things back then</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but seeing peoples emotions right now, it isn't something that is very useful to the world today</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Todays society wouldn't like this product very much because if they wanna know a persons emotions all they have to do is ask.

In today's society people dont want others knowing their emotions. If they want to know they can ask and if that person wants to tell them then they will. This device is an invasion on peoples privacy because not everyone wants you to know their feelings. This device wouldnt be used by very many people in the world today.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
