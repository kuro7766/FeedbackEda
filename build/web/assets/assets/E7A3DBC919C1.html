When people hear about this device they may think that it isn't worth it, but it could be useful when it comes to things that happened long ago. Seeing other peoples emotions can be harmful to them unless they allowed you to do so. A lot of people want to hide their emotions and keep them to themselves. Emotions are something that can be shared or they can be kept away inside somebody. They can tell people or they can hide it, either way its up to them. This is why this device isn't helpful to the world.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.274628074,<span style="color:white">0.718784426</span>,0.0065874980599999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Again it may be helpful with things back then</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.2034215632,<span style="color:white">0.7932771080000001</span>,0.00330130416]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but seeing peoples emotions right now, it isn't something that is very useful to the world today</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.1605713409999999,<span style="color:white">0.83332388</span>,0.00610478364]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Todays society wouldn't like this product very much because if they wanna know a persons emotions all they have to do is ask.
