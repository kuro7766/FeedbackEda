Dear TEACHER_NAME, <span style="color:orange">8th students should be able to use cell phones during our free time as long as the teacher allows it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.064853939,<span style="color:white">0.9261076</span>,0.00903847078]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Either way the phones will be turned off during class anyway, because some kids be going to the nurse and the nurse don't always call there parents so they don't always get pick up if they are sick</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0759856926,<span style="color:white">0.910766478</span>,0.01324782022]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So like during lunch they would maybe be able to text or call there parent to come pick them up. So either way students are going to end up using there cell phones anyway don't matter what the problem is. Some students might leave there gym clothes or homework they had that night. They wouldn't most likely pass that day. Most likely, because they weren't able to ask for of there parents to bring there stuff to them, because they didn't know they left it. It makes since what i' m saying because, nobody knows what is wrong with the person except the person its self. Like they might have a problem and they need picked up and the person don't want nobody to know about it</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2191891199999999,<span style="color:white">0.75729388</span>,0.0235169906]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Some people I know most likely use cell phones anyway to get checked out or just to check, because they be "bored" and don't want to learn.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1229409669999999,<span style="color:white">0.8677747480000001</span>,0.00928431208]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So as I was saying you should allow 8th grade to use cell phones because this is our last year at this school it's suppose to be fun. Since this is the " Best Middle School In The World". Without the 6th and 7th grade being allowed to do it with us</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.394712058,<span style="color:white">0.602598534</span>,0.0026894155199999]</span>  . <span style="color:white">So please think about this opportunity and please let this be aloud.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.614328862</span>,0.3845865979999999,0.0010845636399999]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
