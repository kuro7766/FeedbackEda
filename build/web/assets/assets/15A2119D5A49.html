You see an electoral vote is technically a voice for the people of the state depending on the population of the state. Many states are large in size meaning that opinions, beliefs, and needs are not all the same. That's where the Electoral College comes in, they voice the votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.107201863,<span style="color:white">0.74901964</span>,0.1437785086]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Majority rules most of the time,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0884918756,<span style="color:white">0.705173526</span>,0.2063345887999999]</span>  now it may not be what some people want but if it is what most want then I believe its fair.</br></br><span style="color:orange">Only the 2000 election was disputed over.

Instead of knowing within a year or a couple months we'd know by the time the presidents term is up. Americans don't have the patience to wait all that time, "Time equals money." Electoral votes are much quicker and the certainty of the outcome of what you as a civilian want living in a certain state is very likely.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.359218006</span>,0.517972296,0.12280971148]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Therefore Electoral College should be kept instead of Popular vote, because it is time consuming, it is good for big states, and it is less likely of a dispute.
