You dont have to stare at a clock and worry about reaching your deadline. You can go back to check on your work as many times as you need to. Reviewing your work allows you to correct your mistakes. You can focus when you aren't panicing about losing time to complete an assignment. Being rushed by time can be very stressful and cause problems for a student.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0730990484,<span style="color:white">0.87099946</span>,0.0559014696]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Distractions are never a good thing, so why work with them?

Food being handed out in class creates a ruckess by everybody wanting a snack to chew. Wrappers of candy, bags of chips, and sodas being opened creates a noise that is tempting. When a student misbehaves, teachers have the ability to write them up and let upper athorities take action.
