Also, there are tectonic plates to move the land.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">One other reason I think it is a landform is because, if aliens were to create the enourmus structure, how would they do it and why would they do it? To me, there is no other explanation other than it was created by natural landforms</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">Also, whos to say that aliens are real or not?
