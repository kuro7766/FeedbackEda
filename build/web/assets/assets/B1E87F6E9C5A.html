People are fooled by the president when they say "I will lower taxes, Protect the environment, or Stop the wars we are in" I thnk that it's a trick for them to win the votes they need to win.

If the only thing that make people happy is to be heard by the bigger people in life. If you where a 18 year old kid in a small state trying to make aÂ  new product that could help millions but your in that state that wont let you be heard by the rest of the country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.385424162</span>,0.58713111,0.0274447388]</span>
