Dear principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that policy 1 is better because when you have free time what will you do?</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0711516035999999,<span style="color:white">0.8977077400000001</span>,0.0311406427]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If you tell students to read when they have free time that's not really free time because they're still working. I will give you some reasons why i think that policy 1 is better then policy 2.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.279177698,<span style="color:white">0.7132727339999999</span>,0.0075495885]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">One reason why policy 1 is better is because if you tell students to read a book when they have free time they won't want to do it because they've been working all day.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0561990235999999,<span style="color:white">0.8821528799999999</span>,0.0616480694]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So if students don't want to do something they're not going to do it. Most of the time when you tell students to do something they don't want to do they start disrupting class and getting in trouble.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.155817491,<span style="color:white">0.8239729500000001</span>,0.0202095385]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Another reason is because students do it without permission anyway.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1243909627999999,<span style="color:white">0.851906828</span>,0.02370219874]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So giving them the right to have their phone out during free time will help a lot of people stay out of trouble. This would be a good policy to make because almost everyday people get their phone taken away for pulling it out during class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1165914219999999,<span style="color:white">0.8615861579999999</span>,0.02182241224]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If you make policy 2 a rule it won't make a difference because students are still going to do it anyway</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1180431679999999,<span style="color:white">0.8517142</span>,0.0302426432]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So you would be way better off with making policy 1 a rule. Policy 1 would stop a lot of people from getting their phone taken.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2361286859999999,<span style="color:white">0.7554345739999999</span>,0.00843674436]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The last reason i can think of is students might actually do their work so they can have their phone out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0958855956,<span style="color:white">0.875814342</span>,0.02830005826]</span>  <span style="color:white">I believe that will pull up a lot of students grades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.2795357839999999</span>,0.7129989140000002,0.0074652926]</span>  I <span style="color:orange">hope you decide to choose this policy because i think it would really help students bring up their grade and stay out of trouble.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1213310992,<span style="color:white">0.86392992</span>,0.0147389683599999]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
