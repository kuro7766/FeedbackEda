Movement of one or more muscles is called an "action unit. Also Dr. huang observes that artists such as da vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.60378726</span>,0.392178806,0.00403391884]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Dr. Huang also stated that most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication.

In the real smile, the Zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Meanwhile,muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the Zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.612146666</span>,0.384086802,0.00376652612]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So based on what i put down on this final draft my claim is that this kind of technology is valuable.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.533895828,<span style="color:white">0.4638506139999999</span>,0.0022535631]</span>
