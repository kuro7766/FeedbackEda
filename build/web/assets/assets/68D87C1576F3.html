No spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours. The last time someone lasted awhile on Venus was three decades ago. The author talks about how it is one of the hardest planets for humans to study.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1553560552,<span style="color:white">0.8290041880000001</span>,0.01563974494]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Venus is covered in almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and the corrosive clouds that are sulfurc acid in Venus's atmosphere. The author decribes this by telling us that this is more extreme than anything humans have ever encountered. Since Venus has high pressure and temperature, it is the hottest planet in our solar system.

It says that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans. Venus includes familiar features of valleys, mountains, and craters. NASA is trying to get more humans to study Venus by allowing scientists to float above the fray in a blimp-like vehicle hovering over Venus. It wouldn't be easy for humans but they would survive.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.225873767,<span style="color:white">0.7610315940000001</span>,0.01309461616]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">At the end of this article they talk about how humans really need to know about Venus. For humans to really understand how Venus is, scientists would have to get up and personal even though it could be very dangerous. Researchers are working on making machines that would last long enough on Venus without it being dangerous. Some electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber with Venus's surface and they have lasted about three weeks which is very good. We have to try our hardest to meet our challenges even though they are dangerous. We should always try to meet our imagination.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.133524984,<span style="color:white">0.8327061519999999</span>,0.0337688331399999]</span>
