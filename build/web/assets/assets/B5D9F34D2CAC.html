For example on paragraph 4 it states that, "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." This is stating that Astronomers know that one day Venus will change and humans will be soon able to land on it without much difficulties.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.17382472,<span style="color:white">0.805900364</span>,0.0202748858]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The information just from Venus could even help us explore other planets and solar systems far from our solar system</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0895635208,<span style="color:white">0.874256778</span>,0.0361797454]</span> . <span style="color:orange">With the information we could possibly find another earth-like planet faster or easier. On paragraph 8 it states, "...but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." This quote is stating that our curiousty will soon take us over and eventually humans will do anything to findout more about Venus or anything in general. I believe that someday we will be able to find the truth about Venus and more information or data that can help us with exploring other planets.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.195697656,<span style="color:white">0.76956558</span>,0.0347367686]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">All of us have thought of what will happen if the current Earth we live on is destroy or inhabitable.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1813280651999999,<span style="color:white">0.796493938</span>,0.0221780244]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Well our 2 options are either Mars or Venus, if we knew more of the planet Venus and how it behaves.

This is a good reason I think Venus will be able to accept humans and find more facts and informations.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.4658552379999999</span>,0.528357152,0.00578760662]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion we have wondered how things are in Venus. We even wanted to know what would happen to humans if they went to Venus. There would be lots of information if we visited and came back perfectly. With all those information we got from visiting Venus it could help us with other difficulties from different planets. The Venus we know as of right now could be different as we learn more about it and find a way to change it closley to Earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.128414236,<span style="color:white">0.8246565739999999</span>,0.0469291938]</span>
