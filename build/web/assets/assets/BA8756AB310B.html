Instead of you doing it for them. People have been littering for years and it is now time for people to take responsibility for there actions. We need to show them that doing a little work for the community can make a big difference in our world that we live in today. It is time for people to fix there mistakes and admit what they have done wrong.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1270461313999999,<span style="color:white">0.6100960360000001</span>,0.2628578508]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I hope that you consider my letter as a letter of hope and a chance for something new. So do what is right and allow people to relize that when you do something for the community it will do something back for you. Which would be a nice, free, cleansed world that is safe for others to live in and you no longer have to worry about the safety of the environment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1325595454,<span style="color:white">0.709116378</span>,0.158324043]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>Student Book
