Even during the school year most students hate doing projects because the teacher assigns mostly boring projects, that no one wants to do. When they're completing the project they can set up how they're going to present it to. If your school did this, what would you prefer to do?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1279238572,<span style="color:white">0.7786402139999999</span>,0.0934359193999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If the students choose the topic they complete a project on, they will actually think about it and get it done.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.03575397766,<span style="color:white">0.7444911700000001</span>,0.2197548378]</span>  <span style="color:white">They can use their creative side of their brain and come up with a very educational but exciting project idea.

When they're in the area they could go on tours of the city or country they're in. They can go see the landscape and learn about the past/history, especially if it's a historical spot.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.201287596,<span style="color:white">0.711932864</span>,0.0867795298]</span> </br></br>Keep in mind they're still just kids they need to have fun from the project, especially if it's over their summer break. They need to have crazy and fun nights with their closest friends, I mean maybe their friends could teach them something about the project they have to complete. Hanging around their family at a cookout is always fun in the summer, and their family could have their own knowledge about the project. Staying up all night on the internet may not be smart, but it sure can can lead you to information you could learn for your summer project.</br></br>In conclusion, <span style="color:orange">students should be the ones who get to choose what their educational projects are going to be about over their summer break. If they create the topic they will actually get it done knowing that their school didn't give them a boring topic to learn about. They can also go on many crazy and exciting adventures to tour and get information on anything they need. Most importantly they need to have fun because summer is about having the time of your life, but they can also learn about fun and educational topics.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0256633878599999,<span style="color:white">0.712215852</span>,0.262120774]</span>
