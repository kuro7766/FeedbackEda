They have all 44 major muscles in the computer 3-D model, and when they move the muscles was like human muscles. So they are can just like human to read human emotional. And maybe they will better than human. They read the emotional like doing the math homework. They will check all you muscles to read you emotional, even you try to make a not really emotional.
