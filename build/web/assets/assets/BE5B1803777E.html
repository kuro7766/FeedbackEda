It is very posible that they did but, not very likely that they did. You have to look at the facts that it might actually be a natural landform, this argument could go either way but again look at the facts and how we got a ten times sharper look at it and how Mars works, it could work the same as Earth and we don't consider Earth to have aliens on it, we don't blame aliens on our land features. Every planet is different and Mars could turn out to have storms and earthquakes and tornados just like we do on Earth, just remember that next time you think that aliens are real, look at all the facts, ALL the facts and then make your decision.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0993440136,<span style="color:white">0.827493456</span>,0.0731625196]</span>
