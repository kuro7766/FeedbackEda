In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amont of elecrtoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,  then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe  chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.1171149975999999,0.3740578500000001,<span style="color:white">0.508827175</span>]</span> </br></br>In source two it says that electorals who have been select by the state can choose their opposing candidtade, which is more disatvantgeing to the american people and america's future.  <span style="color:yellow">for example if one state candidate was choosen for republican and they were "faithless" as it says in source two, and chose the democratic party it would be very unfortunate for the republicans because than there would be no point of the votes the republican supporters have voted for. It only comes once every four years, this is very important to the american people, on choosing who they want for the future of america.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0835306618,0.6507676800000001,<span style="color:white">0.2657016284</span>]</span> </br></br>In source two and three it states the rule " winner take it all" .
