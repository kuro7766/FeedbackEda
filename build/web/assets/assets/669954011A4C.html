<span style="color:yellow">Do you think attending class online from home will benefit you and your studies? My sister took a class online that was required for her to graduate. She rushed through it and it was a huge waste of time. Therefore she didn't gain any knowledge. It would've been more beneficial if she took the class in school with a teacher in the same room as her with more instruction.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0253349713,0.292837576,<span style="color:white">0.68182743</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Attending a class online at home can prevent you</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0638744151,0.57258537,<span style="color:white">0.3635402179999999</span>]</span>  from: <span style="color:yellow">learning your social skills</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0104475972,0.354424394,<span style="color:white">0.6351280100000001</span>]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">participating with hands on work,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0090516076599999,0.3298135439999999,<span style="color:white">0.66113484</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">learning time management skills.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00989917614,0.33661617,<span style="color:white">0.65348465</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">School is a very important part to peoples life.

She has introduced me to so many other people and has got me out of my comfort zone. My favorite part about the friendship is the memories we have made, the trust we gained, and the respect we have for each other.

Therefore, you can retain it and be able to apply it when it comes into play. I was in my 7th grade science class on a Monday. The week before I took a test on the biology of a spider. I didn't learn anything about it because I was sick and wasn't present in the class for the lesson and instruction given by my teacher. I missed a whole week and in the week my teacher gave out ways to help remember the information about the spiders life. I struggled so much on the test and didn't perform well. My teacher gave me the opportunity to retake it. I stayed after school and took notes while she presented me with details and ways to remember the steps of the spiders biology. That night I went home and re wrote my notes out until I can remember all the information she taught me. I took the test. Later, I found out I scored perfect on it. Im a visual learner and have to be present in class to be able to comprehend what I learn. I have to write everything down or drawl it out so my brain will be able to remember the information. If I don't remember the information on a specific test I have coming up, I can go back into my notes I wrote and re-write it out so I see the words again and again which helps my brain remember it better.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.003969331054,0.0591197584,<span style="color:white">0.936910888</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Some may argue that, getting instruction by teachers is a waste of time,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0209082698399999,<span style="color:white">0.402708222</span>,0.5763835079999999]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">however it helps students find clarity in the information they are presented with, which they are required to learn and know it.

My friend attended school online from 1st-8th grade. When she got to high school she didn't know how much time she should give her self to get all her work done. She struggled with it and ended up failing all her classes her first 2 years of high school. She was so distracted by other things while she was doing her work, likewise, she never completed the work that she needed to get done and ended up not turning the work in. The summer going into her junior year she was depressed but also was very stressed. She ended up committing suicide and it was very hard for me as well as a lot of people to comprehend. A lot of students have a hard time with this task because you have to plan it out and go step by step through the process, but also giving your self enough extra time just in case you dont get it done within that period of time. Its a hard task to map out due to peoples distractions happening internally or externally in their lives.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0288956946,0.490875648,<span style="color:white">0.48022865</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some may argue that you would dont need to manage your time because it won't effect your school life</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0230325798,<span style="color:white">0.450696996</span>,0.5262704140000001]</span> , <span style="color:orange">however, managing your time is such a helpful tool that will help you become a successful person not only in your academic life but also your work life when your older.

In the past, students haven't obtained much information while attending online class and puts them below average. That effects their life in a negative way and adds a lot of stress into their lives. Students could be more involved with work and enjoy school if they attended school on a regular. If we get ride of students attending online classes it will help students become a more out going person, learn the task that will help their life be more successful, and teach them the best way they learn.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0131003803199999,0.44104171,<span style="color:white">0.545857904</span>]</span>
