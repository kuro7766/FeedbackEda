<span style="color:orange">The electoral college in many peoples eyes is a good thing but, there is a majority of other people who would much rather have a more direct vote because all though one president got the popular vote among the voters, the electoral votes count differently. One direct vote could count for ten votes or it could count for two votes and most people would rather have their vote count as just their vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0300000446,<span style="color:white">0.530434824</span>,0.439565136]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Electoral votes in a lot of peoples minds is just unfair all around.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0492535426,<span style="color:white">0.7565448459999999</span>,0.194201624]</span>  <span style="color:white">One president could be the favorite among the voters but the electors the president has to back him up with electoral votes could maybe not be as big as another presidents electors and its pretty much, in many peoples eyes, giving the least popular among the people president an easier way to become president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.2657347479999999</span>,0.6630320439999999,0.0712332188]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Adults that vote like knowing that their vote really counts for the person theyre voting for.

People find this way of voting unfair because they dont like the fact that the person they voted for could get the most popular votes, but the number of electors there are for the person is not very many, so their votes count as less than others do. Many feel that they are being deprived of their right to vote because one person could be voting but they get 10 votes while another peson could be votin and only get 6 and its not equal for all people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.194791125,<span style="color:white">0.598102006</span>,0.20710687]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">People who vote for a president that gets the most popular votes, and they dont win the election, can start big disputes among the way the elections are carried out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1169638094,<span style="color:white">0.645510566</span>,0.2375256385999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When a president wins only the electoral votes and not the popular vote, many dont feel like they are actually their president.

The electoral college is not based on equality because everybodys votes count differently due to supporters or electors who are pretty much the ones getting the votes. fixing the way people vote and how they vote can change the way some people feel towards the preident no matter who they are. Let the people vote for who they want and not the electors because it would make more people more open to vote than there are now.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0273617848,0.478256354,<span style="color:white">0.4943818699999999</span>]</span>        Â
