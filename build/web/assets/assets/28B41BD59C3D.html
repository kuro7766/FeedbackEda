The planet has a surface temperature of 800 degrees farien height. Also the planet has a much higher atmospheric pressure at over 90 times greater than Earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Venus is closer to our plant than we thought. Even thought its atmosphere contains clouds that are made out of higly corrosive acid. "The surface has a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters". The terrian is showen to be ruff but not unbarable for human colonization. Also Venus is one the closest planets to own own planetthan most others.

Over the years Venus has been a topic of study due to its earth like qualites.
