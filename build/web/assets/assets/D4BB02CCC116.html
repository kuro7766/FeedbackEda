Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I am writing this letter to convince you that you should not do this policy change.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0606364432,<span style="color:white">0.8723648520000001</span>,0.0669986854]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There is many students that may have a high C, and it wouldn't be fair if they didn't get to play sports because of it. Read on and I'm going to explain why you shouldn't do this.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.146829566,<span style="color:white">0.831632162</span>,0.0215382753999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This is not a good idea because it wouldn't be fair to some students if you take there privileges away from them because of one bad grade.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0290902381999999,<span style="color:white">0.7952979360000001</span>,0.175611828]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I specifically think that this situation is by far not fair at all. For example, if a student had just one bad grade, and it was a high C, they still would not have any of the privileges to participate in any sport activities.</br></br>I am telling you not to do this to kids because, it is not right to take this away from them. Maybe if they start participating in other school activities such as, math counts, the academic team, and so on, this could help kids bring up there grade in certain areas. So in my opinion I think you shouldn't do this to children just because of one grade.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.097348298,<span style="color:white">0.733151832</span>,0.169499858]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Some more of my ideas, is that you should let anybody who wants to participate in sports still do it if they have a bad grade. You should let them play any sport they wanted to but if there grades start to drop, not let them anymore because this means they are to focused on sports to do there school work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2911851419999999,<span style="color:white">0.687645674</span>,0.0211691701999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">These are some reasons, that you shouldn't do the policy change.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.414487412</span>,0.5803584279999999,0.0051541894]</span>  I hope some of my opinions will make you change you're mind and not do this to children.</br></br>Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
