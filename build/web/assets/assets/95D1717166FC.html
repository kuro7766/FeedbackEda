<span style="color:orange">Venus is Earth's sister planet. But along with being our sister planet, Venus has the highest recorded temperature of any planet in our solar system. Along with having the highest temperature recorded, Venus also has an atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than the atmospheric pressure on Earth. Clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid also coat Venus's atmosphere, making it difficult to even make it through the outer layers of Venus's atmosphere. So why would Earth's scientists still want to vist Venus?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.1206529683999999,<span style="color:white">0.551110536</span>,0.3282364894]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">According to the article, Venus is the planet that is most similar to Earth, well at least it used to be.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0904849932,<span style="color:white">0.758079824</span>,0.1514351619999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The author tells the reader about how Venus was probably covered in oceans that could have supported life, similar to Earth.

He goes on to say that the temperature would be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, not an ideal temperature for astronauts traveling to Venus, but it is survivable.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.253329118</span>,0.663645438,0.0830254492]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">While traveling to Venus may take Earths scientists years to figure out, and be very costly, the information we could learn would be invaluable.
