<span style="color:orange">"Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions." -Nick D'Alto. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is very amusing system that can read how a human is feeling. The thought of a computer software being able to decipher what I'm feeling is shocking.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0384187278,<span style="color:white">0.7030204679999998</span>,0.258560806]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I believe the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of a student in a classroom is valuable.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0256781908999999,<span style="color:white">0.746886734</span>,0.22743506]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There are many reasons why I agree with the use of the FACS.

With more practice the computer could then change the difficultiness of the assignment according to how the student feels. For an example lets say a gentelman is stuck on a math problem. The frustration that the gentelman is showing will be seen by the computer. The computer will then help the gentelman by modifying it or infroming the teacher where he is struggling. This will better his education and help out more when students are scared to ask for help.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0245338516,<span style="color:white">0.593250304</span>,0.382215814]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The positive effect that the FACS has on the students is another reason why it will be vaulable in classrooms.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0560213406,<span style="color:white">0.75313246</span>,0.1908461936]</span>  <span style="color:white">In the passage it says," According to Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expreess emotions, but also may even help produce them.

The solution to this would be to modify the infromation to be interesting or less difficult for a student. I assume that this would decrease the amount of missing assignments and improve grades.

They will help improve their interest in topics at school, help the students understand better, it will help students be more possitive, and finally is will have a big impact on all of us. The Facial Action Coding System would be a new way of gaining more knowledge. It will help students and teachers understand eachother better. Overall this would be a positive impact amoung us all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0280408274,<span style="color:white">0.67359686</span>,0.2983623199999999]</span>
