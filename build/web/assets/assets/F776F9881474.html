I remember when I was in like 5th or 6th grade and my teacher was like "I know its the end of the year but you guys and girls are gonna have to do a summer project". After she said that everyone hated her for the rest if the summer and not just because she gave us a summer project but also because it was very boring</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.275268146</span>,0.706094014,0.0186378348]</span>  but <span style="color:orange">if it was not boring then I am pretty sure everyone would not be as mad as they were.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.203428114,<span style="color:white">0.7827158540000001</span>,0.0138560189]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe that if students got to choose the summer project then more students will get it done.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0571249755999999,<span style="color:white">0.8988954659999999</span>,0.0439795518]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I know for a fact that if I was to get a summer project it would not most likely not get done but if I had a choice to pick it or have my teacher pick it I would pick it my self any day of the week. If I would was to choose my own summer project then I am almost 100% sure most kids would like to pick their own summer project. Just like 2 summers ago I had to go to summer school because I was not doing so good in my cases and the teacher said that all we had to do was a project and we would be all good and we will be ok to go to the next grade so I was relived so I went home and got started on it but when I got started I realized that it was boring and if something was boring I was probaly not going to get it done.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.393320104,<span style="color:white">0.57326296</span>,0.0334169494]</span> </br></br>I am saying all of this to say <span style="color:orange">I think that if schols make kids do summer projects they should be able to pick what they are going to do</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0921058298,<span style="color:white">0.879462584</span>,0.028431581]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">it will be more fun</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0816250591999999,<span style="color:white">0.895101322</span>,0.0232736056]</span> , more kids will do it, and <span style="color:orange">it gives a chance for kids to think on their own.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.078409918,<span style="color:white">0.88803938</span>,0.0335507048]</span>
