The planet's stmosphere is made up of 97% of carbon dioxide and corrosive sulfuric acid.

It has similar geological features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Due to its close proximity it may be the nearest option for a planetary visit. NASA in particular would like to send humans to study the planet. They thing that if they have the space craft hover about 30 miles above the planets surface they may be able to avoid the brunt of the problems.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">The temperature would still be about 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>
