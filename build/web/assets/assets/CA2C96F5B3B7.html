<span style="color:white">Hello, my name is Lisa, and i'm a scientist here at NASA. I have heard that you claim that aliens have created this landform we found on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There has not been any life found on Mars at this momment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, <span style="color:orange">all i'm trying to say is that it cannot be aliens, it's just a rock on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  Thank you for your time.
