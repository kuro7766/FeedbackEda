Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">There has beeen some recent heat on the topic of the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I believe that it is only fair to keep the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Although some voters may be upset with the fact that they don't define who wins the presidential election,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">it is best that way.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">If there was no Electoral College people with no actual idea of whats going on would vote, and that could have a negative affect.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  Also <span style="color:yellow">if there was no Electoral College there would be an unfair amount of votes in larger states.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  The last reason is <span style="color:yellow">Swing States, which is also a very important part of the voting process.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br>First and Foremost, <span style="color:orange">the Electoral College may make voters feel like they have no input on the election,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but really they decide who the Electoral voters choose.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Without Electoral voters, there would be indecisive people voting for a candidate they know nothing about.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">For example, many young voters base their votes off of popular opinion, not what they think is actually right. If there was no Electoral College, the Nation could be in a lot of trouble because many votes would be casted off of popular opinion. So it is good to have some control over what happens and who becomes president, but I think having the full decision to vote for whomever, and have it count, is overdoing it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Secondly, I believe that having the Electoral College is great because, without it larger states would have more of a say on who becomes president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">This would be very unfair to the smaller states for an obvious reason, population. Even though a few states might have a bigger population that doesn't particularly mean that everyone in the state will vote. There are still "independent voters". For example, as stated in paragraph twenty-one, the election voting in Florida was very close and relied a lot on popular votes. Florida ended up getting twenty-nine electoral votes, compared to Wyoming who only got three electoral votes. State size does matter because larger states will typically always get more attention from the presidential candidates than smalller ones.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Lastly, The Electoral College is a very important part of our voting process becaue of Swing States</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">As stated in paragraph twenty, voters in toss-up states are "more likely to listen to the campaign and the competing candidates". These voters know that their votes wont make much of an impression on the election, but pay the most attention anyways.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">People claim that the most involved voters should be able to decide the elections.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Although they don't have much of a say it is nice to know that people do care about the elections and do pay close attention to what is going on.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">To conclude my previously stated reasons, I believe that having the Electoral College is a crucial part of the system. Because without it the nation would have so many voters that only cast their votes based off of popular opinion. Also without it larger states would have more of an affect on the votes than the smaller states do. Finally, Swing States are a very important part of voting because voters who know what is going on and actually pay attention do have one of the biggest affects.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective]</span>
