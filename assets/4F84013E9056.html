Dear, State Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that we should not change the way we vote we should keep the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0964150939999999,<span style="color:white">0.89371232</span>,0.0098725493999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Maybe instead of changing everything we should keep what we have.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.167121676,<span style="color:white">0.8265364</span>,0.00634191796]</span>  <span style="color:white">Most likely everthing will be a total disaster. If we change everything it will all fall under the pressure. We really dont need change in the world today as it is. It will be hard to get up after this big of a fall.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.63465012</span>,0.363183562,0.0021662951599999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Well what is bad about the Electoral College is that it is unfair for the voters that is doing the voting.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.1436230732,<span style="color:white">0.8501981000000001</span>,0.00617883448]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Because it is all about the system of winners taking all. Some candidates dont spend time in the states. If they really know that they do not have the chance of winning. They say that this stuff is outdated and irrational. They are thinking of abolishing the Electoral College instead of keeping it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1986162899999999,<span style="color:white">0.7920470180000001</span>,0.0093366854]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">But on the other hand what is good about it is that it is widely regarded as an anachronism</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.248846816</span>,0.7447595680000001,0.0063936355399999]</span> . <span style="color:white">It is a non-democratic method of selecting a president. But it is not a democratic in a modern sense. But it is good because the people vote for a trusted slate of electors. But the trusted electors vote for the party`s nominee. Even though the Electoral College has a lack of most everything.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.388582952</span>,0.605702406,0.0057146394]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Everyone has that one good argument.

Well because in the year 2000 a election called fiasco was one of the biggest election crisis in the century. The legislature`s are technically responsible for picking the electors. Well also the electors can defy the will of the people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.336170568,<span style="color:white">0.6578311400000001</span>,0.00599828516]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Also this thing can be argued.

This was a good topic to argue about. I hope my responce will help to understand my point of view of things. I really do hope that we do keep what we have going on with the voting thing. I really do not think we should not change anything.
