In a way the government is deceiving their citizens by the way our voting method is set up. When people vote they feel a sense of independence because they are allowed to choose who they would like to represent them in congress. But instead once they place their vote it goes to electors rather than a simple vote towards the one they selected. If you were to change the way people's votes were counted it would be easier and faster to elect a president and get him into office to fix world-wide problems.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0421187052,<span style="color:white">0.436347356</span>,0.521533928]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In all three articles at least one section has made it clear on their opinion to abolish the electoral college.

It saves time for electors and it gives people a chance to see who they are really voting for. Presidents would have to go to each state and appeal to them in order to get a vote. I belive that is what we need. They would be required to actually work for a position in office rather than speaking on whjat they are going to do and paying someone else to elect them. We should have faith in our president and know who we are voting for before we cast our vote. This system seems more fair and more modern to the twenty first century. This is a system most Americans would agree with.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0114818318,0.228472756,<span style="color:white">0.760045396</span>]</span>  So to end my argument I simply say think before you act and truly try to do whats right.
