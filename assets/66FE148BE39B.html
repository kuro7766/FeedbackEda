<span style="color:orange">The Electoral College is a compromise between the election of the President by electoral votes. This has been around for as long as I can remember. It plays a very big part in our government.Â  Some people want to get rid of it. Others don't. Do you think we should keep the it?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.098261286,<span style="color:white">0.74147648</span>,0.1602622467999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The Electoral College balances out the amount of popular votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1538943068</span>,0.80461629,0.0414893882]</span>  <span style="color:white">If both candidates are tied, we turn to the state electors. The candidate that has the biggest amount of electoral votes wins. One candidate can have more popular votes and very few electoral votes. The popular votes are just for the state electors to decide which they are going to pick. In the end it all goes down to them, The Electoral College,</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.32703591</span>,0.6340579639999999,0.03890611004]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">On the other hand, some people don't like this idea.

Voters think it's unfair. They spend a bunch of time voting for who THEY want, but in the end it comes down to the electors. So in reality it doesn't even matter who the voters choose. They really just choose a slate of electors, who then elect the president,</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.172739356,<span style="color:white">0.775137032</span>,0.0521236106]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think we should get rid of The Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.077925166,<span style="color:white">0.8342113299999999</span>,0.0878634836]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It's not fair to the people</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.122448404,<span style="color:white">0.8378266059999999</span>,0.0397249762]</span> . <span style="color:orange">We waste all our time to vote on a president we want, to only end up voting for the electors.
