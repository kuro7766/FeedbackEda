Technology reading studentÂ´s emotinal expressions</br></br><span style="color:orange">Remember thst one day you were sad ? Just never showed that emotion/ expression so you would not get ask ? Your apperence is never what you actually feel on the inside is it ? That is because face expression hids it all. Now there is a computer system that catches your human emotions.</br></br>According to some new technonlgy named, Facial Action Coding, this system identifies humans emotions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This technology is not the right way to find students human emotions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Facial Action Coding seems to just identify just your face. A face expression can hid your actual emotion</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:white">Systems like this have the chance to not be right. Make believe what this system is all about.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Secondly, the students expression may change during the day</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">At some point a studnets can feel pressered after a class of even before there next class. These emotion have the accursy to not be the same during a students day. Calculating these emotion, can not be like working on a math problem. Emotions can change in the matter of a second. You just dont know what can happen at any minute that changes your expressions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Lastly, this system would not be good to keep students emotion</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">It would be better to talk the student face to face, if you ever see or feel like something it going wrong with them. Like the article says you never know how your teacher feel when she is grading your assigment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe the Facial Action Coding should not be used on students. I would rather let a teacher talk face to face with there studnets to see what the situation is all about. Rather then just guessing or coding there face and believe a system like the one that Prof. Thomas Huang invented.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
