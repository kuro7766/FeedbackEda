It would be expecially good for parents.

These devises put out blue light into the the eye which is bad because, this can cause straining in the eye or even total blindness. when you are on your phone most of the time you have acess to the internet which means you can get on social media websites. When on websites like snapchat and instagram teens tend to compare their selves to others, and if they aren't up to par to look like "pretty" people they can get sad and form some type of depression.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.130263828</span>,0.798298432,0.071437769]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Overall, students should build more life skills and social skills, and adding extracurricular activity's to the students day can help with that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0477635654,<span style="color:white">0.8789565659999999</span>,0.07327987]</span>  <span style="color:orange">building life skills at a younger age can be great so, when you get out into the world you'll atleast know some key factors to living.
