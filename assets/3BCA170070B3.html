Dear senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think the Electoral College should be brought down and let the popular vote decide who the president of the United States will be.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">First of all, I believe the popular vote should be kept and the Electoral College brought down. I think this because what if some people dont agree with the opinion of others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">For example, lets say two people are running too be president of the United States. People vote and everything but then its up too the 538 electors. Then the 538 electors choose who they want as their president, 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President, as weeks go by, the new President is one of the two people that ran too be President was elected. Some people are happy and some people are mad because they put their vote in and they voted on the other person but that other person won and now they are angry.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>
