Driverless cars might be a good idea for long road trips, but just think about how much work those cars would need if they broke down.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">On the positive side these driverless car might be a good idea for someone that's always is on the go & they get tired of driving.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It may also be good for the mothers of young children. Only when the child is crying the can have the car driving it's self while they get the baby in order.
