" <span style="color:orange">electronics made of silicon carbride have been tested" this is one way they are trying to advacne technology to be able to study Venus. The scientist would taker such a risk to because NASA is inhancing their technology. NASA is even building " mechanical computers" which was important to World War 2 becasue of the calculations it made. If this computer made calculations for the war then it would probably have a lot of effect to the scientist on exploring Venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>If you had the chance to ecxplore Venus and be apart of what's goign to happen would you? <span style="color:orange">Even though Venus is a dangerous risk, people and experts would love to know the knowledge that the planet will give us. We also woudln't have as big as a risk if these technologies would work out. Maybe the scientsit aren't so wrong on this mission I mena they are experts. Scientit would love to the risk to expirence Venus, give information to others, and have our society grow more in education.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
