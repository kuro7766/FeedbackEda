The scientist would taker such a risk to because NASA is inhancing their technology.

If this computer made calculations for the war then it would probably have a lot of effect to the scientist on exploring Venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.294792228,<span style="color:white">0.695155708</span>,0.0100520393]</span> </br></br>If you had the chance to ecxplore Venus and be apart of what's goign to happen would you? <span style="color:orange">Even though Venus is a dangerous risk, people and experts would love to know the knowledge that the planet will give us.
