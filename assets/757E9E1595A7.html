Dear principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I am writing to you today because of the issue of community service,</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">it has become apparent to me that some kids are not on board with the idea of it and think its to much work for to little pay-out. How-ever I do not agree with them</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">the kids that say these things are the slackers they are board at school don't do their home work get bad grades and so-on,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">but community service is a good thing to do</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">it helps other people and you get good karma for it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I do think that kids should be able to chose how much they do with a minimum amount of 3 hours.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">This would let the kids who challenge themselves continue to do so, and let the slackers become more used to the idea of work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Now i' m not saying that there isn't a little bit of slacker in every one</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">but to be successful in the job market these day you want to be a hard working individual who doesn't mind doing something for others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Community service will get the idea of that in their head and hopefully send them on the right path through life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>sincerely your friend,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
