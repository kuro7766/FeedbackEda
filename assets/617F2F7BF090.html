This is because while playing a sport you may have a two to three hour practice three to four times a week not including a game or two, that you have to play in each week. Another effect of sports on grades is that they leave you tired and exhausted, which makes it much harder to keep focused in a classroom environment.</br></br><span style="color:yellow">If you are going to change something about the sports program change how long the practice can be or the amount of practices allowed per week.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0151529348399999,0.32704991,<span style="color:white">0.657797186</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">That in itself will give the student athletes more breathing room so they will have an easier time bringer their grades up. If these work than you can keep the required average at a C, but if these fail, that is when you would be obliged to make the required average a B so the students have more drive to keep their grades up. But at the time I think you should change the limitations of the sports programs in itself before any of the grade requirements are changed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0938235382,0.4808802199999999,<span style="color:white">0.425296244</span>]</span>
