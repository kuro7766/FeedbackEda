In different scenarios, It would be very convenient and unique for kids to continue their learning while enjoying their summer at the same time. They would go to school the next year and only need very little, if any, reminders of what they should've been learned the previous year.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0099497500599999,<span style="color:white">0.2107627412</span>,0.779287506]</span>  I think <span style="color:yellow">student-designed summer projects would be an awesome addition to student learning over the summer.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0180109548,0.467696152,<span style="color:white">0.51429289</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Many students either get left behind a grade, have to do summer school, drop out, or just barely pass and end up going into summer not knowing any of the material their teacher has tried to teach them. Things they should've previously been learning would seem new to them. As a student I will admit that some of the material is quite confusing at times.

Generic_Name does not understand the WWI subjets in his history class. He's been doing his class and homework, been paying attention, he's been writing his notes, but he still does not understand the subject. He's asked his teacher for extra help and has recieved it. While his knowledge for the unit is growing, he still just barely passes his Standards of Learning test with a 401. Over the summer, his school required all students to make up their own project about anything they may have learned. At first he did not think it was going to help him but he decides to give it a try anyway. Generic_Name decides that if he has to learn about something over summer, he might as well learn about something he's been having trouble with. He completes his project with just a month left of summer and now has a better understanding of the war for his next year of highschool.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00469543486,0.0758062341999999,<span style="color:white">0.91949835</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">In order to help kids better undertsand things, not only should we do projects at the end of every quarter during school, we should do them during summer too.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0089231728,0.2887594640000001,<span style="color:white">0.70231736</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Students will get smarter and teachers would be much happier when their whole class can raise their hand and answer questions about the new material they are going over.

The project is expected to be taken serious as an SOL would. It is a great way to make sure that students would not forget any knowledge over their summer. Also, it would be a great excercise for thier brains as well as it would get them ready for college if they plan on furthering their eduction.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.00635197588,0.17513154,<span style="color:white">0.818516472</span>]</span>
