Movement of one or more muscles is called an "action unit. Then his friend Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FAC (Facial Action Coding). Dr Huang then observed that "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">By using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks the facial movements in either or real face or painted picture of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions, each expression is compared against a neutral face. In fact, Dr. Huang said that we humans perform the same impressive calculation everyday, like for instance, me going to one of my close friends and seeing them frowning I will assume that they're upset about something.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">According to the machine if you frown at it, the next ad will be different.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I feel like a machine like this would be very useful for computers so they can track if a student is getting distracted, tired or bored, because I feel like it could give the student a warning or something to not fall asleep during a test.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">And lastly, no, the expirement didn't really make me happy, I tried smiling and it felt awkward.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">According to the "Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion" moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but it may even help producethem in a way,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">which was very shocking to me because I never knew anything could work like that.
