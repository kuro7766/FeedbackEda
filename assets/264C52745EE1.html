Community Service</br></br>Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I think helping out in the community would be fun.</br></br>To me helping people out is a good way for people to get to know you.</br></br>It also helps make out world look better!</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think you should have the school adopt a road and help pick up trash that people have left behind.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It would be great for people to understand that just because people in jail are doing Community Service doesn't mean that its a bad thing to do.</br></br>I think if you required us to do Community Service that maybe at first not very many people do it, but i think in the long run a lot of people would join.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Second, i think Community Service would be great because most people in our community that are doing Community Service are the people in jail.</br></br>To me when i see people doing Community Service i think of that too.</br></br>But if you get more kids to do it, people will realize that, Hey maybe this would be good if all people did this.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also the air we breathe in wouldn't be as polluted, and if we got together people not in the school district ,but out of our town it would be a lot cleaner.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I understand that maybe it might be a bad idea because a lot of kids my age have a lot going on like basketball, baseball, football, school work, and much more.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">But i promise if you just did this like once a month when there is nothing going on I'm sure there would be no problem.</br></br>Also even if there was a practice on the schedule, the coach for the team or whatever there is a practice for the he/she wouldn't mind them doing some community work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">All i have to say, I think this would be good for our community, and you have my vote!</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
