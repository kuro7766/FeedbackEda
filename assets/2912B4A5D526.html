Dear, senator</br></br><span style="color:orange">I'm writing you this letter to address and give you my opinion onthe argument about keeping the clectoral college or changing to election by popular vote fhor the president of the United States.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I feel that we should remove the electoral college</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">because it seems like we do not use all of the votes to have everyone's input on the election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">The electoral college consist of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. My question is "Why not use all of the electors votes instead of using only anout 55% of them?". We say that every vote counts but if we are not using all of the electoral votes then that means we are just contradicting our statement.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">From articles I have read, Under the electoral college, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the resident. Let's say if you lived in Texas, for instance , and wanted to vote for Kerry, you would vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Voters can not always control whom their vote for and sometimes voters get confused about the electors and choose the wrong canidate</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Some people may say that electoral votes should be kept so that it would make it easier for them</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but i feel thatelectoral votes are confusing and should be removed from a process of electing the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerly, PROPER_NAME
