Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">Community service is a way to distinguish selfish people from selfless people. Some people do large amounts of community service such as working at a soup kitchen and donating food to a food bank. Some even take it to the next level by going and helping out in places like Africa. Unfortunately not all people are open to helping people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.005651960406,0.1370595872,<span style="color:white">0.857288464</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">At our school we should enforce that kids have to participate in community service at least twice a year.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.01214198736,<span style="color:white">0.32079567</span>,0.66706233]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Community service makes people feel better.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.038611508</span>,0.4656974239999999,0.4956911]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">It is a very moving experience when you give food to someone who is hungry. It teaches you to be appreciative of what you have after you see someone who has nothing. It also makes you feel good inside. Having community service might change the attitude of some kids at your school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.02723186192,0.389164754,<span style="color:white">0.583603378</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Some people think that community service is useless or a waste of time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0502803118,<span style="color:white">0.542144638</span>,0.4075750399999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But in reality it only takes up a few days a year of an average persons life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.0679450274,<span style="color:white">0.557248406</span>,0.374806562]</span>  <span style="color:orange">To only make the kids do two days of community service is no high price for anyone. It even doesn't take up the entire day, only a couple of hours.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0988443204,<span style="color:white">0.552694784</span>,0.348460872]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Community service helps people, makes you feel better, and is not a humongous time consumer. Anyone who has some extra time should defiantly chose to do some. No one has a busy enough schedule do not be able to participate. As the principal of the school please require students to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0360832941999999,<span style="color:white">0.424473184</span>,0.5394435200000001]</span>
