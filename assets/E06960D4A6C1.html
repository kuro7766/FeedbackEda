They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidental candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidnetal candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? Presidental candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0369258646,0.295922458,<span style="color:white">0.667151652</span>]</span>  This all leads to the next disadavntage of the Electoral College, unfairness.</br></br><span style="color:yellow">As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, "... Al Gore ---thanks to the quirks of the electoral college---won the popular vote but lost the presidency." The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01083073876,0.203262914,<span style="color:white">0.785906314</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidental voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0321640874,<span style="color:white">0.552479116</span>,0.415356798]</span>
