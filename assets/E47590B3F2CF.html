But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China" That shows that you can see lots of places, but that isn't the best part!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">You also have a lot of free time on the way back from a trip.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When we unloaded all of the animals, "The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed.
