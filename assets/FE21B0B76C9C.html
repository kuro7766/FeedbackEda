To the principle, and students.</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that not all the students should be required to do the community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  . <span style="color:orange">I think that the principle would be very shocked just to see how many of the student would wont to cleanup their school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I bet that many of the students would think that doing the community service would just make them look very stupid to their friends.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But what some of the students at the school needs to realize is that even if your friends may think that your crazy for doing it is not always about what your friends may think. Some of the times a friend my not know what` s best for you. And I say if you think that it would make a difference in one persons life then it was all worth it. And no matter what every person wants to live in a safe and also clean place no matter were you may go.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  And <span style="color:orange">I think that if the principle would require them to do it then that is not fare on the principles side.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Most kids loves getting involved in doing things for their community.</br></br>I think that for all the friends that think that it takes up to much time you should just try to work something out like a real friend would. No one sad that you had to work all day it doesn't matter if you only do the community service for five minutes at least you can say i did something to help out my school and my community. Not to may people can actually say that they helped make a difference in their whole community. So all for all I just wont to say,</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">just because your friends may no wont to do something that doesn't mean that you don't have to either; and also to say that you cant make people do what they don't won't to do and that comment goes to the principle.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>  Well i hope that every thing works out good and that you have a lot of volunteers to help clean up the community. Good luck!</br></br>Sincerely: STUDENT_NAME
