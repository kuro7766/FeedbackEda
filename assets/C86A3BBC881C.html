Dear Principal</br></br><span style="color:orange">Many students might have a' C 'as an overall average, but taking away sports isn't really fair,</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">every kid needs exercise to keep their mind and body healthy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Grades are important,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but so is the need to exercise.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I could understand the fact of kid aren't putting enough effort into their work</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  but <span style="color:orange">what if its not their fault what if their trying their best but they don't have any encouragement from their guardians</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">A possible solution is the student with an average of a 'B ' should get a more variety of activities available, that way everyone get all the exercise , needed</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Most of those grade 'C' students are just having a hard time , they shouldn't be punished for doing their best</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">they should just spend some time reviewing simple mistakes they have made in the past.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Lastly, <span style="color:orange">taking exercise won't only make you unhealthy it . Makes your mind unable to work to its fullest extent</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  . <span style="color:orange">For some people doing activities such as basketball, baseball, and football allows them to relieve their selves to clear their head to be able to focus on the main task at hand.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I hope my reasoning will persuade or atleast give you second thought on changing the school policy. I am one of many students who believe it is wrong to change the school policy .</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely :</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
