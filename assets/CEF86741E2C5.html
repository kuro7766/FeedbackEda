<span style="color:orange">The Electoral college has been around for a long time but, do we really need it? Is it your votes that affecting your next president. Under the electoral college it is not. The electoral college says that voters do no vote for the president but for a slate of the electors, which elect the presidents</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.072975844,<span style="color:white">0.846410644</span>,0.0806135058]</span> . <span style="color:orange">We need to kept the voting process we have now</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.1078233419999999,<span style="color:white">0.86438731</span>,0.027789342]</span>  <span style="color:white">so that way we don't arguments throughout the states. In the electoral college yoor vote is sent to someone not holding public office.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.49523192</span>,0.49870557,0.006062540468]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">When you vote you are getting a slate of the vote and to feel that their vote does not matter, that the new president will have no regard for their interest,is he really your president. The way we vote today is not that best we can do in some ways. I think that we need to have all the voters votes count towards the president that they want.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.24373553</span>,0.7335190500000001,0.0227454371399999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">We should let the people vote for who they want and not for someone else to vote for you. The constituiton says "We the people, By the people,For the people." So we should vote for who we want to represent us.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0807110484,<span style="color:white">0.84495398</span>,0.0743349802]</span>  <span style="color:white">The electoral college is based of a winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.472818306</span>,0.521113632,0.0060680541599999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Another factor that is wrong with the electoral college is that bigger states like Californa get more votes than Columbia</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0963259168,<span style="color:white">0.856605454</span>,0.0470686322]</span> . <span style="color:white">So for example, say that Californa gets 45 electoral votes and then Columbia has the same amount of voters vote for the president they want they will only gte about 5 to 8 because of the state size.

The electoral college isÂ  the president wins by popular vote. The electoral college has a total of 538 electors but,</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.4872647799999999</span>,0.506900044,0.00583517264]</span>  <span style="color:orange">sometimes the electors don't always listen to their voters and vote for who they want not who the state wants.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0845560273999999,<span style="color:white">0.8591555719999999</span>,0.0562884296]</span>  <span style="color:white">The president has their own group of electors which have been chosen by the canidate's political party, but certain state lwas vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The election is every four years on the first Tuesday of November, which gives you time to think who you want to be the next president and cast a vote</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.450837518</span>,0.538511172,0.0106513127999999]</span> , <span style="color:orange">but with the electoral college your vote could not really count.

We decide who we want to run our country but, e need to think about how the voting process really works. I am only one person but, one person can make a difference. So just remeber on thing 'We the people, By the people, For the people."</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.156731615,<span style="color:white">0.7979951679999999</span>,0.0452732198]</span>
