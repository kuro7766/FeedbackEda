There your students are destracted and are not listening to your lecture or lesson for the day. Then you have to stop class and get onto the students. Then you may have a kid tell his mom or dad you yelled and told the class to stop goofing around. With their emotions. Then they call the school and you then have to go to a meeting about what happened. Then you will have to try not to get into trouble by the state or you head leader. This could cause a lot of disruptions in the class and they will not get the education that they are there for. I am not saying that there is not already a lot of destractions alreadyby phones, talking, and chromebooks.
