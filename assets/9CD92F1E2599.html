<span style="color:orange">Dear state senator, as time moves on things needs to change. The way we vote for our president is unfair, outdatede, and irrational.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It is time we change things and move to a election by popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college was founded many years ago by The Founding Fathers. It was a compromise between the election of our President. It selected electors thats would put the vote in after we voted. It was a great idea back then</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> ... I think <span style="color:orange">it is time we change this and let the people vote</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">We cann't use the same ways as time moves on</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">This should be an election for the people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">In the electoral voters don't even vote for the president. They vote for than elector. This could very well be anyone holding public office</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:white">People sometimes get confused and vote for the wrong candiddate. Back in 1960 louisiana nearly succeeded in replacing all demoratic electors with ones that oppose John F. Kennedy. Somestimes faithless electors have refused to vote for their party. This is outrageous! What is this happens again</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . With the time and place we are at now these things should not be happening.</br></br>Futhermore, the people should elect who becomes OUR president. <span style="color:white">We are the that have to live with this president</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Another reason is because its unfair to voters</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:white">the winner-takes-all system shows that caue candidates don't spend time in states they know wont will. And if the electoral college gets a tie it would be horrifying. Leaving it up to the House of Representatives.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">All of this is to show that electoral college should be Abolished. This is outdated, unfair, and irrational use. Putting our faith in people we don't know has caused problems.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
