Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:white">I have heard that many students are arguing on whether community service should be done by the students and i just wanted to share my opinions with you to help your decision.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Community service, i believe, is a great way to help people who need assistants and it helps us become better people</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">There are many things us as students can do such as</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> : <span style="color:orange">reading to the elderly, babysitting, and picking up litter from the parks or streets</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but also children like to have time to do fun things.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Children always want to have fun by playing with toys, going to a boiling alley, or going to see a movie</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  but <span style="color:yellow">life in my eyes has to have a little responsibility and in what better way than to help other people in community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I, as a student, have always done community service because it makes me feel like i have accomplished something important and because i have helped my community in someway while also having fun.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">So my conclusion to you would be that children should be requested to do community service but not so many hours were it takes the away the fun in life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective]</span> </br></br>Yours truly,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
