<span style="color:orange">I think that students should be allowed to use there cell phones during lunch. Because it is there free time and there not in class. Cell phones shouldn't be allowed on in the classrooms, but lunch time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So I would have to agree with policy 1. You should allow students to bring there cell phones to school as long as there off in the classrooms.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Just in case there is an emergency after school while walking home or waiting for your parents to get them</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Students should also be allowed to have them on after school even though it still on school grounds. You the principal or vice principal should allow cell phones on during lunch time, because the students are not bothering anybody it is there free time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  So why take them away while there out at lunch?</br></br><span style="color:orange">We just maybe want to listen to music, play games, text, or call people on our cell phones</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I honestly believe that it is really not fair that the teachers take away our cell phones while there out during free time or some other activity</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Even if your at volleyball tryout's they should be allowed because you're not inside the classrooms disturbing other students your enjoying your own time. Others just want time of there own as they can during school hours, just get a break from all the homework or class work they have to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Just for 40 minutes (lunch) of our day we want to use our cellular device. Everyone should have a chance at least every other Friday to have there cell phones on during lunch time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  If you the principal or vice principal agreed on this also <span style="color:orange">probably more students would get better grades in English, Math, History, or Science if you allowed this opportunity to have cell phones out during lunch periods.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>
