Dear, Mr. Principal 2-1-11</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think students should not perform community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">it would seem like they were getting punished for something they didn't do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Doing community service would take too much time from doing school work students rely need.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If students decide to clean up the community then they should be able to do it</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If a student were to do something to brake the rules then they should be sentenced community service as a punishment depending on there crime. for example if a student were to start a fight the student should do a number amount of hours doing community servis.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The students that chose to clean their community should be provided the tools to do the job because they don't have to do anything and some kids cant afford to do so. for example if a student needs a tool the city should provide it</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">I think if the student wont to do it then they should do it and get offered to get paid for it because nobody would wont to give up their free time for free.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Your student,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
