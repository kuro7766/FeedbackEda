Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new elecotrs who would oppose John F. Kennedy. ''So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.'' In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused tovote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.</br></br>Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The Senate would choose the vice-president. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters,would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for preident and another party for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.3973348440000001,<span style="color:white">0.3620404499999999</span>,0.240624714]</span>
