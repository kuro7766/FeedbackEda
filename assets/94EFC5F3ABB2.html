DEAR, Senator</br></br><span style="color:yellow">Changing the electoral college would not be an great idea due to the fact that it has been around for centuries and would negatively impact the voting system. Some believe the voting system is a very unfair and outdated system because of the electoral college. When changing the system to popular vote it will affect many people, it may also come out worse than the electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0594384893999999,0.708581432,<span style="color:white">0.231980097</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">3 big points why the electoral college should stay the same</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.083255262,<span style="color:white">0.8694418819999999</span>,0.0473028761999999]</span>  is one <span style="color:orange">because the electoral college has been around keeping voting in place for centuries</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0626931046,<span style="color:white">0.865922132</span>,0.0713847752]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The second great point is that a disaster only happend once</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.09440833,<span style="color:white">0.8553647260000001</span>,0.0502269574]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Then the third main point is the winner take all idea is a great idea for the electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.12902001,<span style="color:white">0.82177666</span>,0.0492032959999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college has been around forever so why change it now</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0626534008,<span style="color:white">0.855514358</span>,0.0818322688]</span> . <span style="color:white">Some belive that the electoral college is a good idea Because of the voting way in the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. which is good because people need to have a leader of there state and that leader shows them which president is really good for whta they do. Presidents talk about what they are gonna do to help the country and the slate elelctors define what the presidents are gonna do to help out that certain state. Then the people of the state vote there slate electors for good reasons. The electoral system should stay around alot longer the system is just rigt for voting.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.27461172</span>,0.691006294,0.0343819738]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral  college is in good shape for staying and not changing a disater only happend once 14 years ago back in 2000</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0681498986,<span style="color:white">0.8524174179999999</span>,0.079432692]</span> . <span style="color:orange">That means at least  3 elections happend since then and nothing went wrong</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.187098233,<span style="color:white">0.79916053</span>,0.0137412328]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Even though if the electoral college system is such a good system then why was there such confusion in th200 fiasco.
