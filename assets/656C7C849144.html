<span style="color:yellow">When electing the president of the United States, you must vote in favor of the president you want. However, instead of coming down to popular vote, the system uses the Electrolar College to decide. The Electroral Vote works in that the people of a certain states votes for their candidate and the majority of people who vote for a certain president give their votes to a slate of voters. What this means is that the popular vote within a state wins the electoral votes of the electors who then vote for the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.00327466976,0.0871360312,<span style="color:white">0.909589286</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Many people dislike this system including myself.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0084407516199999,0.27915924,<span style="color:white">0.712400022</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I disaprove of this system because it limits representation</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00459226984,0.21430011,<span style="color:white">0.7811076399999999</span>]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">permits the disintrest of voters</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0059618033,0.218910992,<span style="color:white">0.7751271940000001</span>]</span> , and <span style="color:yellow">reduces a candidates intrest in a state.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.01117886596,0.2211340299999999,<span style="color:white">0.76768711</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">One major problem with the Electoral College voting system is that it limits representation of the people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0026873554999999,0.154957592,<span style="color:white">0.8423550260000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The Electoral COllege votes work so that the population of a state directly effects the amount of votes that states recieves. For example, Wyoming only has about 500,000 voters so it only recieves one electoral college vote.
