They will have to vote the president by using the Electoral College.

His goal was to "Abolish the electoral college!"</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1324598272,<span style="color:white">0.7448504899999999</span>,0.1226896644]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">When people also vote for a presdential canidate they actually vote for the slate of electors. Which was why Gore had more popular votes than Bush, yet he had fewer electoral votes. But there is one way to settle a dispute of the outcome of an Electoral College vote. "it happened in 2000-but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote." The Electoral College also has a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal but has enough electoral votes to vote for president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.333405196</span>,0.5663733360000001,0.1002214656]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So now we all know how the Electoral College is unfair. Because of the constant votes that don't matter at all yet they always make sure to vote that president and all of the popular votes wouldn't matter. That's why I want to change to popular votes than the Electoral College does. All we need to do is work together to over come the Electoral College so the votes can be fair and we would want to vote for the president that we want.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0658333244,<span style="color:white">0.6924558019999999</span>,0.241710872]</span>
