High school students and adults should just volunteer to pick up trash on the side of the road. instead of getting paid for it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0693285826,0.48532449,<span style="color:white">0.4453468871999999</span>]</span> </br></br>Volunteer work is about helping people and helping the community. It's not about helping people or the community and getting paid for it.
