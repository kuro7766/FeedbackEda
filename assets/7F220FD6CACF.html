''She's 82 percent happy. 9 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." This new technology can calculate your emtions like math. Also using ''video imagery, the new emtion-recognition software tracks these facial movments - in a real face or in the painrted face of Mona Lisa.'' It can define the emotion of a real human and in a painting. There technology is very intresting they construct a 3-D computer model to the face. instead of humans trying to find out calculations them selfs they can use the new technology. Humans can perform the same way as the new technology even tho they are gonna have to estimate the percentigs</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.6546597760000001</span>,0.342922666,0.002417584472]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Also can tell when children or students are tired or bored or falling as sleep so then the technolgy '' could modity the lesson, like and effective human instructor.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0888213088,<span style="color:white">0.90217842</span>,0.0090002922599999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The same technology can make computers-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery.'' so it can keep the students on track and still learn on there school lessons and wont get behind.
