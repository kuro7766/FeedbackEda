<span style="color:white">Hello my name is luke and im am in the Seagoing cowboys program. My friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I work two part time jobs in a grocery store. It was 1945, World War 2 ended in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins.</br></br>This was and opportunity for me to be drafted in the military service.</br></br>I couldn't tell my friend no. So I went with him. The cattle-trip were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small -town boy.</br></br>Also, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA(the United Relief and Rehabilitation). I had the side benefit of seeing</br></br>Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece.</br></br>It took about to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to china.</br></br>I was busy caring for the animals during the crossing. My job was to check on the animals every hour. I also found time to have fun on board. We played baseball and volleyball .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.88792028</span>,0.109845084,0.00223463558]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, i learned that after i graduated high-school life got harder, but i cant let that get in my head. I will face lifes challenges and will overcome them. The trip wasn't about what did, it's about what you learded and its about the adventeur.
