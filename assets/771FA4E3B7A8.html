<span style="color:white">To state senator i'm argue is that we should keep the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">because it's a place where we vote on President and Vice President</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> ,<span style="color:white">and the place where we count the votes</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> ,<span style="color:white">and the Electioral College process consists of the selection of the electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  Reason number one is it's the place where we vote on President and Vice President <span style="color:white">because it's in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress. And election of All the soon President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  Reason number two is the place where we count the votes <span style="color:white">is because a majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President. And when we vote for our candidate we are actually voting for your candidate's electors. And each of the candidate running for President in our state has his or her own group of electors</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . And reason number three is the Electional College process consists of the selction of the electors <span style="color:white">and that is my thrid reason is because were states's entitled allotment of electors equal the number of members in it's congressional delegation:and one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for you senators</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">And this are all my three reasons why we should keep the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>     Â
