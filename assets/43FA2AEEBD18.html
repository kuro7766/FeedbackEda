They say that us at NASA are covering up the fact that there is life on Mars. Another thing they say is that on April 5, 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor took pictures of the Face the alien markings were hidden by the haze due to it being winter on Mars at the time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.152576386,<span style="color:white">0.8045134559999999</span>,0.04291017]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The final thing to say on the matter is that the Face is a natural rock formation. The Face was not created by aliens. The pictures prove that it is natural. The fact that us at NASA say that the Face is natural doesn't mean aliens created it.
