On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get thirty four electoral votes. Who are the Electors? They can be anyone not holding public ofice." so that is pretty bad but yet choosing you own President would'nt be okey neither because it would be harder and no one can give Presidents the ideas and the presidents would have to come up with the ideas alone.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.443859446</span>,0.521475106,0.0346654602]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">in conclusion, you as the State Senator have to leave the "Electoral College" and not change it to "selectionÂ  by popular vote for the president of the united states".</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.2280451419999999,<span style="color:white">0.7516054440000001</span>,0.0203494155999999]</span>
