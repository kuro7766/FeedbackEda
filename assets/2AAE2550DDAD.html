The reason why it looks like it has a face is because the picture was taken at the moment on when the landform had a shadow at the certain places of the landform to make it look like it has eyes,nose, and a mouth. If you look at the picture from 1976 you can see that it shows more of the face and that it does look like a face. But then if you look at the picture taken at 1998 and 2001 you can see that the natural landform on mars is starting to break up and that the shadow on it is now sarting to fade away.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.289640632,<span style="color:white">0.689680002</span>,0.0206793746]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So you won't have to worry about aliens giving out a message to us saying anything bad.
