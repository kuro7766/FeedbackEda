Dear Senator,</br></br>My name is PROPER_NAME from LOCATION_NAME. <span style="color:orange">I wanted to adress the positivity in keeping the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The Electoral College has a small chance of winning with a Electoral College vote than a popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Every state is important because everyone's a president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  Also, <span style="color:orange">there are swing states which is a winner-takes-all method.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electoral College has a small chance of winning with a Electoral College vote than a popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Although in 2000 the Electoral College vote happened</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">it is very unlikely to occur.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Reason is that the Electoral College exceeds the share of the popular vote. Even a slight chance of a state plurality could cause a landslide electoral-vote-victory.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In the Electoral College no region has enough Electoral votes to elect a president</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">This means that a region needs to influence another to have atleast a elected president. For example, Romney was a solid regional(South) which means he focused in one region not the others, concluding his lost. So, it was very likely that Romney would not win because of his appeal to one region.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>In the winner-takes-all method in the Electoral College induces the candidates. <span style="color:white">This was seen in 2012's election. The ost thoughtful voteers would have to decide the election, making Electoral College very fair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>
