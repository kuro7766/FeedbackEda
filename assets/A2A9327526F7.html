<span style="color:orange">Why do you think Don Reist want Luke Bomberger to join the Seagoing Cowboys program ?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Well , i think he wants him to join the Seagoing cowboys program because he probably really like it , and want his friend to join .</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">One reason i think Luke joined because like he say , he think it would be an opportunity of a lifetime</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  . <span style="color:white">in the passage it states UNRRA hires seagoing cowboys to take care of horses , young cows , and mules that were shipped overseas , Luke and Don signed up . The passage also states in August 1945 , they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans . They arrived August 14 which was the day pacific war ended .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Another reason i think Luke wanted to join , because his friend was their and he wanted to be with his friend , and do what he are doing now .</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">The passage states when Luke's draft board learned that he was on a cattle boat , they told him to just keep doing that for his service . The passage also states Luke turned 18 before arriving in greece , which meant he could be drafted in military service</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  .</br></br><span style="color:white">The whole thing to the paragraphs and all the supporting details is that Don wanted Luke to be like him and asked him to sign up so they could be with eachother . They wanted to have good opportunities with eachother t, they wanted to grow up and become something just from being stated in the seagoing cowboy program . Like they say in the story at 18 before arriving in Greece you could be drafted in military . That right there means they wanted to be something like a star that everyone wants to meat or be important or be famous , because lots of times it gets boring sitting around all the time . They said " hey lets get up and go sign up for something to become something together since we are close friends . "</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>
