Like they say in the story at 18 before arriving in Greece you could be drafted in military . That right there means they wanted to be something like a star that everyone wants to meat or be important or be famous , because lots of times it gets boring sitting around all the time . They said " hey lets get up and go sign up for something to become something together since we are close friends .
