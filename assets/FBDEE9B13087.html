Google has been test driving partial-autonomous cars in certain conditions for 7 years and has so far had no crashes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.034187546,<span style="color:white">0.561055866</span>,0.4047565979999999]</span> </br></br>Autonomous cars would not only be a safer alternative to human driving, but a more fuel eficient, and therefore, greener alternative. <span style="color:orange">According to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, autonomous cars would be twice as fuel efficient as today's taxis and buses. With more fuel efficient cars, pollution due to carbon dioxide emmisions will drastically decrease. Fuel efficient cars also help the American economy because if cars are using half as much gasoline, then we only have to import half as much oil, which will save us money as a country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0365129168,<span style="color:white">0.533604262</span>,0.429882824]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Autonomous vehicles would save lives and money. With a computer at the wheel, cars could find the most efficient and safe route to almost any destination. Greenhouse gas emmisions would be reduced, therefore making our planet a better place to be.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.00813870574,0.383781008,<span style="color:white">0.6080802760000001</span>]</span>
