A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is very possible like the total number of votes-538-is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. It is less likely to have a dispute over the popular vote but it is more likely to have a dispute over the electoral vote. In 2012's election voters in toss-up states are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign- to really listen to the competing canidates- knowing they are going to decide the election. Causing the popualr vote to go up. When we as a community should not want to president be chosen by a popular vote but by the electoral vote, it is only fair!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2064218079999999,<span style="color:white">0.584622014</span>,0.208956178]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also, the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives majority of the votes cast.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0484189698,<span style="color:white">0.73813332</span>,0.2134477119999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning the majority in the electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0985150412,<span style="color:white">0.805713426</span>,0.0957715148]</span>  <span style="color:white">Did you know that there is someone from a small state and they only get three electoral votes.
