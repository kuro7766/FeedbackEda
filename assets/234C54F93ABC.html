Dear principal,</br></br><span style="color:white">I would like to put my opinion about students being required to perform community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe community service would have good looks on to our schools.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also it would make our students look like they want to help and change the world</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Actually make it a better place for the children that live in the area.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Community service can help the students that are in high school get into colleges. It can help the students be able to choose what college they want to go to not what college they have to go to</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . I think community services would actually be a wonderful success. <span style="color:yellow">To the older people the younger people may take out the trash for them, mow their lawns, etc. If that would happen this world would be an better place. A place where everyone would get along and peaceful.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also the students would actually be communicating wit each other</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Having fun, making new friends would be amazing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The only thing that may be wrong about it is the whole work time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">You have to know how to manage to keep your grades up and be able to perform in community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  But <span style="color:orange">I strongly believe community service should be required for elementary school students and up</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> . I really hope you take my thoughts and opinions into consideration. Thank you and have a wonderful day.</br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
