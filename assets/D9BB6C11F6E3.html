Or if the students like kids they can go to the daycare to take care of them. Some people want to be a nurse they can volunteer in the hospital. Some people are interested in science they can volunteer in a history or a science museum. A lot of people I see volunteering is a museum are more of senior citizens. Sometimes when they talk you can't hear them correctly. Maybe putting students in the museum will help and themselves can also visit the museum and learn more about history and science.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.03761446814,0.323660638,<span style="color:white">0.638724922</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">A big part of doing community service is that you gain different experiences from different work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0544543502,0.570046316,<span style="color:white">0.3754993199999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When you are applying for a job they will likely to have someone that have the experience of doing that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.316082856,<span style="color:white">0.6352187739999999</span>,0.04869839708]</span>  <span style="color:white">Some people do community service for school credits.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.326428134</span>,0.6381486900000001,0.03542316106]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So I think community service is important and required for the students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.276481008,<span style="color:white">0.6948178859999999</span>,0.0287011067]</span>
