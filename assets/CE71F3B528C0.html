The hospital said she had a really bad disease, and that there was no cure. To double check that information she decided to visit another hospital, they said it was just a simple sickness and they prescribed her some medicine. She then went on with her life and she was fine, but now she knows to double check things, especially if they are going to cost a lot of money. Having multiple options can save you money and stress.

When you get a new point of view you can make a pro and con check list. A pro and con check list is when you list all of the good things and list all of the bad things for that one opinion. These check list are very versatile, and can be used in many different ways. One example is, picking a restaurant to eat at, for the pros you could say, the food tastes good, but the waits are long and the service is not that great. So now you decide you do not want to eat there and you go to an even better restaurant. Another example is, for spring break you want to go on vacation, but you also want to stay home and rest. When you make a list you can decide witch one you want to do most or the one with the most pros listed. Asking others for their opinions can persuade your choices and also give you ideas.
