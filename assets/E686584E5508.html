Muscles called orbiculariaris make crows feet around your eye, but in a false smile. the mouth is strectched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the riorius. So all the muscles can get the coding to scan your face and it'll tell you the percentage of the mood that you are in whether you're sad, mad, happy, bored, it will tell you all of that jazyy stuff.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.816538496,<span style="color:white">0.1810924119999999</span>,0.002369081606]</span>
