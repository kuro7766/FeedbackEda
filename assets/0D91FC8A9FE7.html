This is especially reinforced in younger children, such as grades k-6, as they still need a lot of direction and having a student-designed project would not be as viable or coherent as a teacher-designed project.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.00355271698,<span style="color:white">0.1589125688</span>,0.8375346819999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Teachers have it difficult sometimes, as they are trying their best to provide students with a learning experience, but teachers also deserve to have their job be a little easier</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0369517616,<span style="color:white">0.4787815359999999</span>,0.484266708]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Creating a teacher-designed project as opposed to a student-designed one, would be far easier to grade and create a rubric for</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00318469558,0.199965324,<span style="color:white">0.79684994</span>]</span> <span style="color:yellow">. In student-designed projects you have a lot of variety and no one follows a central guideline, however in a teacher-designed project, you can maintain the variety but also contain a set of rules that benefits both the students and teachers, as the students have more clearly defined rules to guide and provide structure to their projects. This also benefits the teachers, as they can easily grade the assignment and provide a fair grading experience.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0034855317599999,0.143273676,<span style="color:white">0.853240802</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Finally, teachers have everyone's best interest at heart when designing projects.

Students often take shortcuts or the easy way out and while sometimes this can be beneficial to the students and their education, it is more often harmful then doing it the right way and teaches them to be lazy. A teacher-designed project on the other hand, would be designed with the thoughts of providing an enriching experience to the student and hopefully making them a more successful and educated person.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0027751637,0.1293644212,<span style="color:white">0.867860376</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Teachers play well informed, and important roles in a students life while they develop, and education is a very big part of student development so, projects should be designed with a teachers interests at heart.
