So, in case the need to have a human take over arises, an individual would have to be sitting in the drivers seat, paying absolute attention to the road, and await the moment the car will allow the individual to take over. Wouldn't that take away the nejoyment of owning a driverless car? I believe it is even more of a hassle than driving ever would be. A person would have to fight boredom and remain alert while doing nothing other than sitting in the driver seat. To all driverless car companies: driving is paying attention to the road, but the driver is actually engaged, making driving more interesting.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.00675448268,<span style="color:white">0.123516024</span>,0.8697294799999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Not only are driverless cars not fully developed, but they are not even legal</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00430696966,0.23207914,<span style="color:white">0.763613894</span>]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Most states do not allow driverless cars.

These cases would resort in major courtroom battles between average people and multi-million dollar companies. Another potential problem with driverless cars is the change off between driver and robot. If the car signals the driver and the driver does not respond, then what would the car do? A multitude of problems could appear, and all automakers can do is hope they will be abloe to find solutions to these probelms. To quote the article, "Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved." Not only are the companies unsure of what issues will surface, but they are not completely sure they will be able to find solutions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00306055112,0.07950884,<span style="color:white">0.917430616</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Driving has been central to the American way of life for a large span of time, and if manually driving cars has been working, why change it?

Driverless cars may sound high-end and futurisitc, but our cars now do the job well. Plus, there are hazads and roadblocks the driverless cars will have to overcome first. Should we really make state legislatures waste time debating the use of a driverless car that is not completely driverless? Driverless cars have benefits, but they are not street legal.
