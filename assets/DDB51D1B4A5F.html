Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I heard that you were deciding on whether we should or shouldn't do community service as a requirement.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.2179010599999999,<span style="color:white">0.7138953619999999</span>,0.068203599]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I don't think that you should make students do community service. I have some reasons on why you should not make us.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0341978572,<span style="color:white">0.6873260240000001</span>,0.278476144]</span> </br></br>1. <span style="color:orange">Those hours of community service could be spent doing homework or studying.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.041959942,<span style="color:white">0.66322285</span>,0.29481719]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Someone who does sports barely has enough time to get their stuff done as it is. Let alone adding some more hours to that of being away from your homework. Some people might have other things in their life that takes up plenty of time. Someone with broken bones needs physical therapy. Some people might have parents who are split up, and they only get to spend time with one of the parents for a little each week.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0517138707999999,<span style="color:white">0.54298521</span>,0.40530092]</span> </br></br>2. <span style="color:orange">People who don't do community service will find it hard because they have never done it before.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1111090439999999,<span style="color:white">0.6669623660000001</span>,0.2219285919999999]</span>  <span style="color:white">They can be taught, yes, but if you are trying to do something nice, it should be a kind act on your own.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.41288314</span>,0.549886444,0.0372304149999999]</span> </br></br>3. <span style="color:orange">Actions without meaning do nothing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.23132212,<span style="color:white">0.67741085</span>,0.0912670228]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If you graciously take time out of your own day on purpose to help others, then you are doing a very kind act. If you are doing it because someone told you to, it has no meaning. It is just a chore.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1018417352,<span style="color:white">0.7219573979999999</span>,0.176200858]</span> </br></br>Those are my reasons on why i think community service should not be forced on the student body. I hope you will take my reasons into consideration, and I hope you will be guided by God in your decision.</br></br>From,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
