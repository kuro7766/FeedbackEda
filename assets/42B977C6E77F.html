Both of the policies are a good thing to do for the school, but sometimes Policy 2 could be a lot harder to handle at a school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Policy one would be a good policy because some kids do need phones at school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some kids might walk home, and if there is an emergency they can be able to call whoever they need to call. In some cases, the child could be staying after school and the mother might have forgot and the mother would've been able to call.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Policy 1 is exceptionally fair for kids too.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">kids can have their phones on during lunch but they have to turn it off during class. If kids turn their phones off during class there wont be any disruptions and everything will be okay. Another thing about Policy 1 is that if people respect the rules and don't text during class they wont get their phones taken away as much.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Policy 2 would be a good policy too</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span> , <span style="color:white">but not as good as Policy 1</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If kids walk home and have an emergency, what are they supposed to do? kids should always have their cell phones with them just in case something bad like that happens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also if there aren't to be phones at school then kids would try to sneak phones into school</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If kids sneak phones into school a lot more kids would get in trouble. So it might be more stress on the school and the teacher to look out for phones instead of not paying attention to what they are teaching.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Like I said before, I do think both of the policies are good, but which ever one is better for student and their safety should be better for the school.
