Dear. State senator</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think we should banish the Electoral College becuse we the people decide who the president is not  Electorals.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0723424478,<span style="color:white">0.8791627200000001</span>,0.0484948442]</span>  <span style="color:orange">We should just go back to basics and have a normal vote system</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0744481333999999,<span style="color:white">0.887366102</span>,0.0381857886]</span> . <span style="color:orange">This system is no working for our needs so we need a better and direct voting system. One big example for leting go of the Electoral college is the disater factor and it just unfair to voters.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.232153828,<span style="color:white">0.75342524</span>,0.0144209252]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college should be cancelled because there are too many things wrong with it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.072453838,<span style="color:white">0.887390712</span>,0.0401554382]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Like one is the winnner-take-all sytyem, by a couple of votes off and one canidate takes all the points in that state. So with that, canidates will use mostly of he's/her's attention on big states to get all the big points there. And little states see little to no campaign ads for any candidates because of the electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.161632748,<span style="color:white">0.78482569</span>,0.0535415734]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Then swing states help us in the electoral college with dividing the points to the cadidates.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.307137818</span>,0.67708221,0.0157799962]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Help with the winner-take-all system, it just the oppisite of it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.338494724</span>,0.648841598,0.0126637105999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also the electors rarely betrayed the voting. Then the are times where the candidate wins the elctoral vote, then loses the national popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.289734142,<span style="color:white">0.6975913960000001</span>,0.0126744776]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">With all of this infomation the Electoral College should be descarded because it is a non-democratic method and it just an anachronism. And when you are voting, you are voting for electors, not the priesident. And which candidate wins the popular vote wins the election. its just unfair to the voters because they dont really vote for the priesident.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0662917065999999,<span style="color:white">0.862355966</span>,0.0713523154]</span>
