Dear TEACHER_NAME</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think if a student has a c average you should give him or a chance</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.118849339,<span style="color:white">0.872076492</span>,0.0090741805999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">It would be un fair</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.2541492319999999,<span style="color:white">0.7423107459999999</span>,0.0035400096199999]</span>  cause <span style="color:orange">if a student did his or her best and all the could give is a c then you should let them play. A lot of students aren't able to pull of a b average so give those students a chance to play sports.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1645097652,<span style="color:white">0.8257893340000001</span>,0.00970090028]</span>  So will you change that policy for all the students that pull of a b average cause <span style="color:orange">a c average isn't that bad they are still passing</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.136695702,<span style="color:white">0.855302736</span>,0.0080015557]</span>  <span style="color:white">but they can play sports and anything else they want.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.4384734740000001</span>,0.559085828,0.00244069646]</span> </br></br>This is how i feel about your policy, <span style="color:orange">there are so many students that only have sports some people that don't have sports they end up doing nothing</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.206959426,<span style="color:white">0.7847342880000001</span>,0.0083062874199999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">People drop out of school cause they think if they don't have the grades to play sports they cant do anything with their life. So i know you don't want that to happen</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2163841947999999,<span style="color:white">0.77607994</span>,0.00753589104]</span>  so take some time and think about it what you are doing. Before you make your finale decision. So can you please change it.</br></br>sincerely</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
