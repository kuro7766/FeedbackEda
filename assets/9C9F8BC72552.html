Other than that it is not necessary to have phones in school and be using them to talk to each other. Kids would not be following the rules made if they could have their phones with them, they would carry them and never turn them off during a class. Teachers would have build-ups of students phones because the students basically would care about when they could use it, they would do as they please and get their phones taken away. This rule would probably effect most high-school and middle-school students, not elementary students. The older students would not be following rules and would act as though they do not care about the rule, all they'd care about is the fact that they could have phones. During classes like gym and health and foreign language people would use their phones because people would not care about those classes, they may see it as a free period like a directed study/study hall.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1346434403999999,<span style="color:white">0.62192856</span>,0.243428]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Cell phone use during school hours is not a good idea because students will text each other in class, even though they are not supposed to, and will be distracted from their class and would not learn anything that could be important to the class</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0189748598,<span style="color:white">0.752724688</span>,0.228300472]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Teachers would not be able to teach a class without confiscating a cell phone, and the office could get phone calls complaining about how their kid's phone was taken away by a teacher.
