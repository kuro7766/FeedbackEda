Dear Mr or Mrs senator <span style="color:white">I think we should keep our method of choosing our state president</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">it more easier then any other method</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . Also <span style="color:orange">it less time consuming.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">College voting method is the most easiest method to use</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">All we have to do is vote and who ever gets the most votes win. I think its just a fair method to use. I feel like the other method is just to complex so we should stick to the college voting method. almost half of the time to president we choose is the right president for the US.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Another reason we should keep the college method is because it wouldnt take that long.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">All we really just have to do is vote and in no time our president will be in office.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">in conclusion I think we should keep the college method because its less time consuming and its an easier process.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
