There are many reasons for this policy. It also helps the kids not get in trouble as much.

Cheating is really a wrong thing to do, it shows what you know not your friend. Major consequences are handed out to cheaters that can cause them to fail or suffer in their career choices. Therefore cheating is prohibited.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.109054889,<span style="color:white">0.8516446140000001</span>,0.0393005191999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Another thing that is being prevented is the lack of knowledge</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.079887715,<span style="color:white">0.8933657799999999</span>,0.0267464928]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Students think they can text and listen simultaneously. But truth is all the information is going in one ear and out the other. It is important because it can help you in life.

It's not like a prison where they have no cell phone. Students should be very grateful and lucky. They have many breaks to use them just not when it is time to be focused. Hopefully, this will help kids in the future.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0670362271999999,<span style="color:white">0.8776799700000002</span>,0.055283826]</span>
