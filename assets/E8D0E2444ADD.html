<span style="color:orange">Do you know what the electoral college is? I didn't know what it was or what it did until the seventh grade. Well if you don't know what it is it's a group of 538 people who vote for the next president of the United States.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But I don't think we should vote for a president like this.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  Now your wondering, why dosent this guy like the way voting is set up? Let me tell what I think it should be.</br></br><span style="color:white">First of all I think it removes our voting right as an American citizen</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Some of you are probably asking yourselfe, "how does this remove your right to vote?" Well you see if the Electoral college votes and whoever they vote for wins. Your basically voting for nothing because the Electoral College is basically the vote that counts twords the election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Another thing I would want to change is if the Electoral College is the main vote we should just not vote. Whats the point in wasting our time to vote if it doesent even count</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I thi9nk voting should be by popular vote because it lets the citizens choose who they want there leader to be.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Finally I think If we could choose the president it would be better becuse the people would get what they want</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:white">If they dont get to choose there leader than there is no point in doing this stuff at all. This should be a real democracy and let the people vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In general I think voting should be by popular choice and not by the electoral college. As the people of the United States we need to vote for our leaders and keep our rights to vote in this country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
