Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">There is no need to change the school's policy so that students with a B average or above may be the only ones aloud to participate in sports and other school activities. Granted, students must keep up with their school work, but level of book smarts does not effect the qualities for sports or other activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.002289912228,0.133621046,<span style="color:white">0.864089038</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Sports are based on levels of fitness, not brain activity.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00858483784,0.294458032,<span style="color:white">0.696957136</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">If a student excels in a sport, he or she should not be limited to access of achieving their goals in this sport because they are not at a high academic level. Limiting their ability to participate in what they excel in can take away many opportunities. For example, one of your students has the skill to play on a professional sports team, but unfortunately they are not allowed to participate in sports at school because they have a C average. A C average today in math class doesn't determine their future as a MVP.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0078920076199999,0.1869285836,<span style="color:white">0.8051793899999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Taking a student out of sports and other activities will not promise higher grades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0062368228599999,0.26819888,<span style="color:white">0.725564316</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Some students have learning disabilities that prevent them from learning to the standard that reaches a B average or above. Sports and other activities can stimulate the mind and actually help with learning. By allowing the students to participate in both sports and class they have a more likely chance to improve in both.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01014624992,0.298809564,<span style="color:white">0.691044152</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Many students have a C average in school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0135585541,<span style="color:white">0.392725002</span>,0.5937164380000001]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There is no statement that this is because sports or other activities are preventing a higher grade.
