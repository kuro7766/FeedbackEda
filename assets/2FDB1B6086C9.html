Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe that policy 1 is a great idea</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0748159893999999,<span style="color:white">0.913523758</span>,0.0116602506]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">most students sometimes get done with their work before others and sometimes they just have to sit there. By this I mean maybe it would be a good idea if we were allowed to have our phones with us. If this is possible we should keep them off during classes and other educational things we attend while we are at school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.133098294,<span style="color:white">0.8508852319999999</span>,0.01601647272]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think it would be a good idea if we could at least have our phones during free time or when we are done with all of our work as long as we don't bother others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0422142445999999,<span style="color:white">0.921749558</span>,0.0360362108]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It is also a good idea to have our phones with us in case there is some type of emergency while we are at school</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0503266784,<span style="color:white">0.924343744</span>,0.0253296022]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">maybe the power gets shut off or something. The reason i like this policy is because when we are all done with our work, going on field trips, or even just having free time we should be able to have them at least to text the people at our school or maybe if possible people at other schools as long as they are not texting while in class. They could wait until they are finished with all of their work and then text back when they're done</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.131976737,<span style="color:white">0.8428521379999999</span>,0.02517111]</span> . <span style="color:white">I also think we should have them at our lunch period too.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.2090353652</span>,0.782573878,0.0083907829]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think this because maybe when we are old enough to drive or maybe our siblings or parents could pick us up to go out to lunch every once in a while as well. I really think we should not have our phones on at all or out when we are having a test because someone could text someone the answer to a question or maybe if the had a camera phone they could take a picture of their test and send it to them and that would get you in a lot of trouble</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2131786152,<span style="color:white">0.772243066</span>,0.0145782948599999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Mainly i think we should only have them out in our free time, when we are going on trips, when you have showed the teacher that you're done with your work, and at lunch. If you will can you please try to take this into consideration and just think about it and get back with me.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.2111433642,<span style="color:white">0.7792990200000001</span>,0.00955764386]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
