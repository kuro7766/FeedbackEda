<span style="color:orange">Although, many people may think that going to Venus despite the dangers is not a good idea going to venus can also be benitfical with new safety measures, and technolgy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">One reason is, Venus is a sister planet to Earth but we don't know alot about it so we need to go there</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Going to venus can be benitfical in may ways</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">One way is thet it can give scientist good research that they don't have. It can also give them a way as said in the article "to examine more closely". Lastly we could gain more knowledge on living conditions in Venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Even though, Venus is not the safest palce for anyone or anything to be NASA has came up with new safetey measures to ensure the people's safetey</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">For one as said in the article Venus is a hot place. So NASA has came up with the idea that the people that will be going to venus would be floating on top of venus so that they will not only be safe but alive. Another way to ensure saftey is to use silicon devices since metal melts on Venus, and studies have shown that using silicon is efficient, and in the article is said to last "for three weeks"</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">Furthermore, not only do they have saftey measures they also uses technolgy</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">From past reasearch it is known that Venus burns metal so that means that to have good resaerch you have to find somthing that is not meatal to conduct your resarch. So NASA has made another project when they look at old technolgy, and they realised that mechanical computers would help when researching Venus. Mechanical computers conduct "calculations by using gears and levers". Also mechanical computers does not need electronics at all</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">In other words going to Venus can be very resourcful and problaly become of use in the future.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
