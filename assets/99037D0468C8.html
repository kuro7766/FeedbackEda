Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I understand how you feel about community service, and I too agree it is very important. But some students have things to do like baby-sit for their parents or extra- curricular activities and sports.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I do not think community service should be required but it can be an extra-curricular activity</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I think you should consider the idea, and take in the fact that students have other important things to do</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Jobs of some sort, or helping their parents out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>I believe us students have enough to do already like homework and studying, and we also do like social time and to have fun. Its not very fun to pick up trash with your friends and talk than it is to talk to them at the movies. Now I think it should be the students choice if they would want to pick up trash, or help tutor younger children. That is my strong opinion on the situation.</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I also think it could be a punishment for students who misbehave</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I mean, who wants to pick up someone else's trash, its gross I think.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">And students who choose not to pick up trash on their free time shouldn't have to be forced to did it</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">If they want to pick up trash, it should be because they want to and not because they have to</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> . Please think about it, thank you for your time.</br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
