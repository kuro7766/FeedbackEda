Dear Principal:</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think you should make community service mandatory for a few reasons.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">First, community service should forced because it make our area a better place to live overall.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Picking up litter makes it a cleaner and more enjoyable place to be.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Next community service shouldn't be optional because it builds character.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It develops compassion and kindness in people. It helps them realize that the place they live in is important to them and to other people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Lastly, community service is important because it gets people off their couch and in to the streets helping people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It helps to make kids realize how tough the real world is and how hard it will be when they grow up. And, of course, colleges love kids who do good things for their community, like community service!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I can see why people say that community service isn't necessary.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But I think that they say it because they are just lazy. We need to get them out and about teaching children or picking up litter</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">As you can see, community service is crucial and should be mandatory for all kids in our school. Without community service, the state of our city will deteriorate until it is no more.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
