Research is our only way of getting data proven in Paragragh six stating "researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.

Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.353685924</span>,0.60852524,0.0377888358]</span>
