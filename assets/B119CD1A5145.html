To the Principal,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I think that students should all have to do some community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">For example, if everyone did community service a lot of people will be helped.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">They could go to shelters and help serve food or help pick up trash for the community. They could also go tutor elementary school children like they mentioned that some of the kids do that. It would make the people your helping very happy or proud of the community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Students should be required to do a certain amount of hours for community service before they graduate.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">that way they get more real life examples as well.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Plus if you think you are too busy of a person to do community service pick a day when you don't have anything to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Do community service for at least a couple hours it will make you and the people you helped happy and you will also feel better about yourself as well.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">In conclusion, community service is one of the best things you can go do to get involved. More students and even people should start and do community service whenever they can. I think that everyone should help out at least a little because everyone can make a difference. community service is very important and everyone should have a part in it to make the world a better place to live on.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective]</span> </br></br>STUDENT_NAME.
