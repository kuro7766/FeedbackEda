Dear Florida senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I would like disuss why changing up the way we voyte today is not as bad f an idea as it sounds. Changing to elections by a popular vote sounds like its in the peoples hands instead of juts casting out votes on the slate electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Aren't we voting for our president. innstead of countting onn the electoral votes to hep out or, go against out favor, it'd be much more easier to just let the people vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The elctoral votes are utterly useless or unimportant,though. If there is ever happens to be a tie between the two candidates the electoral votes can help break it. It'd be less of a hassle to have the florida residents vote,directly, on someone besides the president. Less worring about if theyre going to win or not</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Now when you start to think about it the electoral college is just unfair an pretty outdated,if you ask me. Change doesn't sound that bad. All im trying to achive by writting this, is to gain actual control over who we're all voting for.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">It's also not just what's completely wrong with the electoral college but how does it help in the first place?</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">When you start analizing it, it really doens't help much. How much actual help can the lectora coellge make, in my defense not much. Why? Simple, its just 20-30 more votes and not many states have that much Hawaii has uop to 4 electoral votes, not much.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Voters should be alowed to directly vote for who they want to be president and not rely on the lectoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
