<span style="color:white">Do you belive in aliens?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>The first reason why i say that <span style="color:orange">the face was just natural landforms</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  is because,<span style="color:orange">there is no such things as aliens!</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For example the text says" a shadowy likeness of a human face." This example show that likeness isn't always certain you have to be absolutley sure before you start making claims about what the picture is showing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  Did you see it for yourself? Did you do any research about it?</br></br><span style="color:white">Another reason why the alien story is real is because ,no one officially approved it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They only took pictures of the face.</br></br>No one went down on mars to examine or observe the face. An example for this would be that the passage says" only this one had unusual shadws that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh". This example shows that if it looks like a Egyptian Pharaoh how would the aliens know about it?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The next reason why the alien myth isnt true is because in the passage it says the word"illusion" the word illusion means something that you can see but is not there.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For example in the tex it states that " formed shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth". This example shows that an illusion may seem real but it is not real. You have to make sure that your facts are reliable and your resources are reliable.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Finally, why people say that the landfrom was formed by aliens is because it</br></br>" appered in books, magazines and radio talk shows--- even haunted grocery store for 25 years".</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They don't know just because this thing goes publice dosen't mean it is true.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For example" Some people thimk that it is bona fide evidence". The people that think taht it is bona fide evidence did they do any research or did they just rely on what the social media says</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">In conclusion you should believe that the face is a natural landform is because aliens isn't real.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
