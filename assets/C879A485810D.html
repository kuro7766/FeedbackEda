Dear: Principal <span style="color:orange">I think we shouldn't do community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">We have other stuff to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">We do not like to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">If we do that we don't have time to do other stuff. I think community service is to much for us. I other people should do it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Like high school students should do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think not elementary school do that cause we are not really to do that. We is not fun to do community service. I think for high school students would it been better to do that. They are old to be doing that. They would clean better then elementary school. I think high school are better then elementary school. So i think you should make high school students do it. But it up to you principal if you want elementary school to do community service or you want high school students but think high school is better. They would clean nice and pretty.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>
