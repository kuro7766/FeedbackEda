We is not fun to do community service. I think for high school students would it been better to do that. They are old to be doing that. They would clean better then elementary school. I think high school are better then elementary school. So i think you should make high school students do it. But it up to you principal if you want elementary school to do community service or you want high school students but think high school is better. They would clean nice and pretty.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.5334263499999999,<span style="color:white">0.449429366</span>,0.0171443134]</span>
