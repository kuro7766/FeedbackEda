In the future humans will finally reach the land of Venus but in the mean time many more features about the planet are yet to be seen and uncovered. The space craft can only provide so much information from a distance that with better technology a space craft may be able to get closer to the planet for more indetailed information. As far as that is it's closer than you'd think and the author's information and details of the planet in the article are very ear listening for any reader looking for information of the planet.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1740192534,<span style="color:white">0.77042963</span>,0.055551122]</span>
