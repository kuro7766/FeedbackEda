<span style="color:orange">The Electoral College shouldn't stay the same, in fact we shouldn't even have it anymor</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">the reasons why we should not keep the Electoral College is because we are voting for electors</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">the tie that occurs in a election</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">representatives in states</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">There is so many problems with our constitution and the Electoral College is one of them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br>You may not think voting is what it seems to be. We don't vote for our president like we should but instead we vote for electors, <span style="color:orange">in which all the electors in that state gives the president their vote if the majority of the population voted for them. Wouldn't it just be easier if can automatically add up all votes for each president since we are so technologically advanced? I say we just let the people of the United States vote the way we should vote and everything would be easier and there would be less complaints</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .</br></br>A tie that occurs in an election is unfair. <span style="color:orange">The House of Representatives is now responsible for the election</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">The winner-takes-all is also a big problem.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The eclection is basically in the "Swing" states because the election is so close.

Says Bradford Plumer in the article "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>The biggest problem in he electoral college is the representatives in the states. <span style="color:white">"Wyoming, representating 500,000 voters, would have as much asthe 55 representatives from California, who represents 37 million," Says Bradford Plumer in paragraph 12. That makes no sense at all. Why would a smaller state with a smaller population have more votes than a bigger state with a larger population? That is unfair to the citizens of the United States and is unfair in the election</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">My arguement for this voting process could continue on. Agree or disagree, you still know that there are tons of problems wrong with the Electoral College. I hope one day it'll change and less talk and arguements will occur, it's time for a new voting process.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
