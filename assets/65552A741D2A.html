We think that this is because of Venuses harsh envirnement constisting of acid rain and clouds, the hottest surface temprature in our Milky Way, and the fact that it is so hard to catch the planet when it is close to our planet. "Also notteble Venus has the hottest surface temprature of any planet in the solar system, even though mercury is the closest to the Sun".
