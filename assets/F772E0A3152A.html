To many americans voting is a very important event. The united states is a democracy. A democracy is a form of government where people have the say, The United States does not follow that route because of electoral college.

In a sense this voting system can be manipulated in ones favor. How the voting system works is considered wrong to many Americans.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.0830368279999999</span>,0.806102288,0.110860882]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Workers in politics such as Richard Nixon or Jimmy Carter also do not believe in the electoral college and they even wanted to get rid of them!</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.03841092,<span style="color:white">0.623694324</span>,0.337894738]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Most people want to get rid of the electoral college because of the "winner take all' system. If it wasnt for the winner take all system George W. Bush would of never been elected as president while john kerry would've taken the spot.

Politicians even disagree with the idea of giving specific people to give the final vote. As senator you have the power to put a end to this unconstitutional doing. The United States is a democracy where everyone matters. Because of the electoral college our opinion on who should be elected has been taking away from us. this event is undemocratic and I ask you senator to think this through and take action on making this voting system to a popular voting system</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.01847814082,0.42219953,<span style="color:white">0.559322332</span>]</span> .Â
