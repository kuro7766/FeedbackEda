The clouds in Venus are different, there clouds of highly corrosive sulfuir acid is in the atmosphere. On Venus the surface temperatuer avage is 800 degrees Fahreanheit acording to the artical. Those are some extreme temperatuers for a human and for a space craft to be stay in Venus. In Venus the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience in Earth, humans or machines can not with stand the heat or pressure of the atmosphere.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.252279932,<span style="color:white">0.7399474460000001</span>,0.00777260686]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Humands cant live in these types of conditions like Venus has a person can end up dead and a machien or a ship can melt</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1238665759999999,<span style="color:white">0.87059885</span>,0.00553457434]</span> . <span style="color:orange">No even a space ship or human landed on Venus in these types of conditions. Samples have not even been taken like rocks or gases because of these conditions in Venus. These types of misions can be super risky to do becasue of they extreme conditions the planet has. Earth and Venus are different, Earth has less extreme conditions than Venus dose but later on NASA is trying to find ways to see how they can have protection on there spacce ships and people to try to get some samples from Venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2804338299999999,<span style="color:white">0.7142263600000001</span>,0.00533977242]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">This is why and how dangerous Venus can be and how there condtions are extreme.
