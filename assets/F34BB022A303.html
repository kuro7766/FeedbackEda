A reason for them not landing a spacecraft on Venus is the extreme temperatures that humans can face. The temperatures o Venus can get up to over 800 degrees fahrenheit, also the atmosphric pressure is 90 times greater than wht we experience on Earth. The author states that a "submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our ocean and would liquefy many metals." The author is saying that if went to Venus with a spacecraft there would be a great possibility that the spacecraft could melt right then and there on Venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.286476648,<span style="color:white">0.685021814</span>,0.02850150064]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author gaves us many reasons why the experiment would be a worthy but also very risky experiment.
