People will hover throw space. In the text says"our jet airplanes travel at higher altitude to fly over may storms."In phragraph five. Flying aroud Venus is not placent. Dispice that Venuse is very hot,bing above is about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The air pressure is lower like the sea leveal. Resiving infromation in venus is limited becouse of how much lights it gives. We can not take anying from mars frome a distance. NASA have not founed a way to get far in to Venus. With this problem NASA takes it risky or as a challeng.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.626827558</span>,0.370793268,0.0023791813]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Anuther way to resive infromation is by sending elatronics to Venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.347287912</span>,0.650383018,0.00232906448]</span>  <span style="color:white">NASA had sent mutuple objets to mars.

Looking at phragraph siven it tells us that "Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers.". NASA uesd newer technology but it has not over three weeks. Sending mechens that are made with meatel it will mealt or over heat because of the heat in Venus.
