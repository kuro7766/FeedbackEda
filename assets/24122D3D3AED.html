Many would say yes in order to please their boss. those who are not willing to work hard to do what even extra activities would probably not be willing to put out the effort for a job. what happens then? You are fired! This would show them to put more effort in order to succeed. the newly proposed rule is a wonderful idea, and will eventually provide the educational system with a higher amount of success in individual schools.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.03435485016,0.2575976089999999,<span style="color:white">0.7080475500000001</span>]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, <span style="color:orange">i believe this could be a quite useful rule and cast my vote for the rule of no students participating in extra activities without an average of 79 or above.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0584096235999999,<span style="color:white">0.671246988</span>,0.2703434132]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
