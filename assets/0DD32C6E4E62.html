Instead, campaigns would focus on the areas in which they already have an agreeable population, as to encourage them to vote, and get the most voters possible, using their resources. Trying to win states, rather than population, allows for voters to be more informed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Effective/0.00220454384,0.096244149,<span style="color:white">0.90155128</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The electoral college might not be the best potential method for presidential elections. It is, however, far more desirable for such a large country than popular vote. Popular vote would lead to neglecting many areas of the economy that are important, but do not have a presence in states with large populations. It would make elections more one sided for each state at the same time. The problems the opponents say abolishing it would fix, would be fixed without it, but doing so would create far more problems than it solved. It is also easy enough to fix the same problems without abolishing the electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.00166730574,0.0659264154,<span style="color:white">0.932406254</span>]</span>
