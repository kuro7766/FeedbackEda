<span style="color:orange">Is keeping the Electoral College a good ideal mr/ms senator? Well if you ask me i say no. Why have it? Say the article voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors but who elect the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Because of the winer takes all system in each state it's unfair to the voters and it's unfair to me so changing the election by popular votes for the president of the united states would be best.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> </br></br>To begin with Having popular votes instead of keeping the electoral college will be better because keeping it will only cause more trouble i say. Why? <span style="color:orange">Well the electoral college is know for being the "Disaster Factor"</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Sad cause not only they have a bad name for there self the Americans are also most worried about the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. Because of the focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states candidates hardly or mostly dont have time to put up any campaign ads. The stress of worring about the electoral college can be tuff, they dont even have to put any signs or ads. Crazy cause it's just this one process thats only counting of the electrol votes for congress</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .</br></br>In concusion <span style="color:white">the Electroal College consists of 538 electorals. Say the article only 270 eletroals are required to elect the president. In the article the system allows for much worse, but wrose as the election crisis in a century? Well i think so!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  Not even think i know so. <span style="color:orange">Electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cased a deciding vote for whomever they please</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">It's all happening, everything i said in the begining...about the trouble. Why the senate gets to choose the vice president? why cant the qualified citizens choose for there selfs. That whole area needs some enjustments before they start chooseing for people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>     Â
