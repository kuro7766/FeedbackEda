Because of the focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states candidates hardly or mostly dont have time to put up any campaign ads. The stress of worring about the electoral college can be tuff, they dont even have to put any signs or ads. Crazy cause it's just this one process thats only counting of the electrol votes for congress</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.339221788,<span style="color:white">0.633797708</span>,0.0269805122]</span> .</br></br>In concusion <span style="color:white">the Electroal College consists of 538 electorals.
