Dear Principle,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I think that students should have the choice to do community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0307529563999999,0.61001496,<span style="color:white">0.359232104</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">I think the only time a student should be forced to do community service is when their being punished.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.038734401,0.5295495100000001,<span style="color:white">0.4317160949999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Most students might have too much to do for community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.03325665058,0.517636858,<span style="color:white">0.449106468</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">If there too busy doing community service the students might not be able to take care of there more important responsibilities. Students might have homework or house chores to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0505772419399999,0.57207149,<span style="color:white">0.3773512733999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think you should let the students that want to do community service do it</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0548706520799999,<span style="color:white">0.621641346</span>,0.323488007]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">If they're always doing community service, when will the students be able to have time to enjoy for themselves. Doing community service takes a lot of time out of a persons day. If there was a test a student had to take the next day after doing community service when schools over and if that student spent a lot of time to do that, then when that student got home, he would be restless and probably wouldn't have enough time to study for that test. I just don't think that community service is healthy for a lot of kids learning environments</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0468901172,0.2783008604,<span style="color:white">0.674808988</span>]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So, this concludes my theory on students doing community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.410930576,<span style="color:white">0.5280945459999999</span>,0.06097489066]</span> </br></br>Sincerely yours, STUDENT_NAME
