Also it can encourage you to step out of the box more and do new things and take more opritunities. School sports teams are a lot of fun and maybe if you like it a lot you can join a sports team outside of school.</br></br><span style="color:orange">Even if sports arent your thing then you could join a club. Schools have lots of clubs including, chess, reading club, homework club, NJHS, video game club and, the green team.

Lots of people who meet while doing a sport or a club end up staying friends for life. School is an amazing place to make new friends. You will never know or experience such great things unless you try. Having a friend that enjoys the same things that you enjoy is good too because you guys can relate on many things. While you go to practice you will always have a partner and you guys can even practice together outside of school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I completely agree with the principals decision. Going to school may be your least favorite thing to do but if you have something to look forward to then school may become your new favorite place. School is a great place to venture out and try new things. Extracurricular activities include sports and clubs and they are a great idea and something that everyone needs to do. The principal has a good point of view because there are so many things to choose from, you could play a sport, join a club and, make new friends.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
