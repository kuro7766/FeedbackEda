In all these situations the car would most likely stop functioning correctly , and quite possibly hurt a pasenger. What if an essential part of the car breaks while on the road? The google car has a special piece of equipment called a LIDAR that keeps a constant 3-D model of the area around. If that piece of machinery fails while on the road the driver is required to take control of the car to keep it from driving into any people, buildings, or other cars. In all of the situations above the driver would need to take control of that unique situation, or else fatalities could occur. These are only a couple examples of what could happen if a driverless car malfunctioned while on the road.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0046400531199999,0.115153698,<span style="color:white">0.8802062660000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," it says that the current taxi system would be taken over by driverless cars. this would put hundreds of thousands of taxi and Uber drivers out of a job. There are also some jobs that cannot be replaced by driverless cars. A job like the trash collector would require the driver to get into the driveway, and get in the correct position to properly and safely collect the trash. Emergerency response vehicles like ambulances, police cars, and fire trucks would also need drivers to get them through traffic quickly, efficiantly, and safely.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0070343197999999,0.2122074159999999,<span style="color:white">0.780758296</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">These examples show that hundreds of thousands of people would lose their jobs if driverless cars were to take over.

There are also people who could damage the car physically by damaging essential external parts of the car. There are also unforseen events that could happen through nature. The car's camera or LIDAR could be covered up acciddently by a leaf or a bug. The car could hit a bad bump and jar the sytems computer.
