<span style="color:orange">As technology continues to advance, cars are seeing advancements in safety and driving capabilities that go further than what the driver can do. Cars the can sense when the car needs to break if the driver is distracted. Brakes that are anti-lock which means they distribute different amounts of braking pressure to wheels that may have more traction to prevent loss of control.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0139553558999999,<span style="color:white">0.327863998</span>,0.6581806179999999]</span>  <span style="color:white">All of these things are very good for cars and keeping drivers safe but are we close to seeing the "Driverless Car"?</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.0589206868</span>,0.597848566,0.343230755]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Cars have features now that can help or completely park themselves with the use of sensors.

As a driver, I know what I am capable of and I feel best when I am driving and I am in control. It would take a whole lot of trust for me to just turn my car on autopilot and let it take over considering there are many things that can happen while you are driving down the road. Many questions come up, such as, Will the car react in time? Will the technology even know to react? Will the car safely and controllably avoid whatever obsticle is thrown it's way. All these things change if the driver is sitting back not driving because the car apparently can do it all by itself.</br></br>Eventually, in the future, it is very possible to see cars with an autopilot function or other self-driving techniques but we are a long way from cars driving without human help.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0449390484,<span style="color:white">0.461800016</span>,0.4932609299999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Laws in all but four states make it illegal to use a car that drives itself</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.04526192554,<span style="color:white">0.5596183920000001</span>,0.395119686]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because, "lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers" (Paragraph 9). So it is obvious that we have a ways to go from a legal standpoint until you will see cars driving themselves on these American roads. This set aside, the advancements in technology is doing wonderful things in the safety category. Cars can avoid collisions or alert drivers if they make mistakes like going over the center double yellow lines. This helps prevent the awful head on collision of two cars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0453668708,<span style="color:white">0.5387113240000001</span>,0.4159218322]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In conclusion, we are not terribly far from cars driving themselves. It is more a safety and trust concern rather than the technology being there. Cars will drive themselves more and more but with the aid of the driver always being there and capable of taking over at any time. But does this make them self-driving if the driver must be present and paying attention at all times? Why not keep their attention by just letting the driver, you know, DRIVE?</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0235710435,<span style="color:white">0.452894854</span>,0.523534126]</span>
