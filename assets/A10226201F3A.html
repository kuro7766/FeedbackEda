<span style="color:orange">Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Schools are offering distance learning as an option for students. I think they should offer it to students. Specially High School students. I have some reasons on why they should be able to.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.091290497,<span style="color:white">0.8983765580000002</span>,0.0103329755]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Students would be able to focus more if their home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0638684214,<span style="color:white">0.92656037</span>,0.0095711995]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They would have a less chance of getting distracted by anyone. It would be easier for them to learn more and better their self at knowing more information than they would at school learning from a teachers pace. Being able to learn at your own pace would be great for students. They would learn the information better.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0925415,<span style="color:white">0.8952065100000001</span>,0.01225197928]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It would better their chances of graduating.

I think they should give the students the opportunity to want to better their future by letting from learn from home. There is a lot of students that want to learn it's just sometimes hard for them. So they should allow them to do so and see how many would succeed and improve a lot more.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0623120624,<span style="color:white">0.919251876</span>,0.0184360197]</span>
