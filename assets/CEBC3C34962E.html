The students will no longer be confused about an assignment instead, they will be able to learn and grow better than if they was in a regular classroom. This is why I think we should have Facial Action Coding System in our classrooms.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0325852516,<span style="color:white">0.82038026</span>,0.147034512]</span>
