Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I believe that the Electoral College should stay.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0322427806,0.565473708,<span style="color:white">0.40228349</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I believe this because even though many people think of it as a horrible way to have presidential elections, it's probably more effective this way.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.02271212698,0.467033888,<span style="color:white">0.510253984</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When people first hear about the Electoral College, they automatically assume that they don't matter to the election, that everything is taken care of by the Electoral College, that if they didn't vote, nothing would change. Now if 1 or 2 people actually had this mentality, then it wouldn't matter, but it's not just 1 or 2 people, it's a pretty big amount of the American population.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.010992513,<span style="color:white">0.249437012</span>,0.739570462]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The Electoral College seems as though our government wouldn't stand for this.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.1459130263999999,0.61287717,<span style="color:white">0.241209806</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">As I stated before, the people feel as though their vote doesn't matter. This is not true. The Electoral College only work if people vote.

I also hope it gives you the motivation to create some sort of video or program that teaches people about the Electoral College with a lot of detail so that they understand why the Electoral College exists and why it isn't a direct vote from the people.
