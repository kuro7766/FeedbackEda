To the senator of florida,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I believe that the electoral college should be abolished.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The system is unjust and prevents we, the people to have our individual voices heard. When americans vote they're supposebly voting for the next president, when indeed they're votes only sway the opinion of the elector.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Think back to a little over a decade ago, to the 2000 presidential elections. Al gore received the popular vote, meaning that he was the one that us, the americans had wanted.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Due to the fact that George W. Bush, his rival, received more electoral votes, Bush won, leaving an unfavored president running the country. According to source 2, a gallup poll was taken shortly after Gore had lost the presidency, an entire 60 percent of voters would prefer to have a direct vote, rather than go through the electoral process.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Granted, that the electoral college does give a certainty of outcome and that no region on its own can vote for a president, it does give an equal chance for everybody to have their mostly preffered president</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective]</span>  (according to source 3), <span style="color:yellow">there is however some flaws to these so called "pros". Faithless electors exist. These electors totally ignore what the people have to say and cast their own vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This occured in the 1960's with hawaii and louisiana, and when vice president nixon validated only his opponents electors, he made sure to do so without "establishing a president", though it can happen again.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">We should all agree with Nixon, carter, and dole on the fact that this system isn't fair. Our voices as individuals aren't heard, and we just vote for the state of electors. We, the people of the united states of America wish to do away with the electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
