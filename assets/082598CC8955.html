Dear School,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that we should be able to have phones out on free time or other reasons</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0785968889999999,<span style="color:white">0.918718444</span>,0.0026846637]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because maybe theirs a reason that we need are phones out like if there's a in emergency if we forget something you never know what can happen</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1054249488,<span style="color:white">0.89104546</span>,0.00352956408]</span>  <span style="color:white">or you can text but you can never have it out in class or the teacher can take it and keep it until a parent comes and pick it up and they have to sign a paper to get the phone. I agree that we should only let them take the phone if there using it in class but like when we are switching to are class we can talk or text for a min but when class starts then no cell phones. But are school we cant have are phones out until the end of the day and we have to wait until we get outside its like unfair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.659135398</span>,0.3390503059999999,0.001814310464]</span>  So that <span style="color:orange">it is ok for us to have are phones out like a lunch or on are free time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.278903592,<span style="color:white">0.719829666</span>,0.001266731192]</span> </br></br>STUDENT_NAME
