There are about 538 electors, now that's alot of people if you ask me. Only 270 of the electoral votes is required to elect the President which is an okay amount of votes for the President election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.806790664</span>,0.1909968212,0.00221251598]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">On the other hand, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who inturn elect the president.
