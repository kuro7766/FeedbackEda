<span style="color:orange">Some Schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break.</br></br>Some may point out that since the students are the ones taking time out of their break to complete these assignments, they should be the ones designing them.</br></br>Others may argue that the teachers should design these projects.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Summer projects should be teacher-designed</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:yellow">the teachers will be the ones grading them,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">they will make sure that there is still an element of difficulty,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  and <span style="color:yellow">they know the content best.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">One reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is that the teachers will be the ones grading these projects.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Teachers spend hours or even days grading assignments.</br></br>If students designed the projects, it would be harder for teachers to determine what the grading rubric should include.</br></br>It should be up to them what they will be inevitably grading at the start of the school year.</br></br>Most teachers have new students every year.</br></br>If students designed these projects, they would be different every year.</br></br>This would lead to mistakes because the teacher would not be as familiar with the assignment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Another reason why summer assignments should be teacher-designed is that they will make sure the project will still have an element of difficulty to it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">It is teachers' jobs as educators to continue create and assign projects that are challenging enough for the level that their students are at.</br></br>If students designed their projects, the projects would not be very difficult.</br></br>This would be because students generally prefer to spend their summers doing other things than homework.</br></br>If the assignments are not challenging, than the students are more likely to forget about it or not care about it.</br></br>The point of summer assignments is to keep the students engaged and learning throughout the break.</br></br>Teachers would make sure that the assignment is easy enough so students dont spend their entire summer stressing about it, but challenging enough so that the assignment is still effective.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br>The last reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is that <span style="color:yellow">they know the content best.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The projects assigned are most likely for the class the students plan on taking the following school year.</br></br>For example, if a student is taking algebra 2 and plans to continue on to pre-calculus, the student doesnt know much about calculus yet.</br></br>That being said, how would a student design a project for a class they havent taken yet.</br></br>The students are there to learn and it is the teachers job to teach them.</br></br>The students should not, and could not, teach themselves the content required to know for the following year.</br></br>The only person who can properly prepare students for a class is the teacher themselves.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, the summer projects that some schools require students to complete should be teacher-designed.</br></br>First, Teachers should be able to create what they will be grading.</br></br>Second, Teachers will also make sure that the projects are not just pointless busy work.</br></br>And last but not least, It is the teachers job to educate student on unfamiliar subjects.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
