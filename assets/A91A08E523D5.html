If I wee presidnet i would want everyone to feel welcome and wanting to listen to what I have to say. Not saying that they would all like my decisons but I would want them invloved, I beileve every president should want their citizens involved and do be able to stay up to date. Statistics show that it has been argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state. " The founding fathers esatblished it in the Constitution aas a comprimise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens".</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.272434624,<span style="color:white">0.6312957539999999</span>,0.0962696512]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Aboloshing the electoral college.  A toll taken in 2000 shortly after Al Gore, the popular vote had overcome the electoral vote. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose presidency. So if everyone make san effort to get involved and do their part, they can have the president they want. If they don't do their paert they shouldn't have a say in it.
