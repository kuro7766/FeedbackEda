Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I would like to say that I support the option to use cell phones during free time throughout the school day.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Students need a way to communicate with out making too much noise.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Using cell phones between class allows students to communicate with their friends even if they are across the school. It also allows them to contact their family if it is necessary.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Using there phones between classes will also help keep students happy and the happier the student is the more likely they are to focus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Even if students were not allowed to bring cell phones to school, they would anyway and then they would use them in class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This just cause more students to get in trouble then necessary.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">If you do make the rule that students cannot bring cell phones at least consider keeping record of how may times each student has been caught with their cell phone and make it a set number of times they can be caught with it until they are severely punished( at least once).</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I hope that you will take my thoughts on the matter under concern, and if you do ban cell phones I understand.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Thank You,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
