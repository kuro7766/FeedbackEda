They could start their own way to help-out with their friends by making a internet site or group.</br></br>You can send out letters to their parents to help get them involved too and make it family related. Also placing more recycling bens rather than trash cans around the school would be great too. A few posters and handouts might also get the idea into their young minds. Emails, billboards, or signs on trucks would also help.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0960297792,<span style="color:white">0.424057386</span>,0.479912831]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Making it a requirement would be best so that the ones who wouldn't do it if it was optional had to.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.045104236,<span style="color:white">0.620670784</span>,0.334224986]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If everyone did community service whether it is cleaning up litter, recycling, or even starting a club to help out, then the world would be better and so would the school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0709648306,<span style="color:white">0.7362911639999999</span>,0.1927440092]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Grades should even go up too.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.0715338921999999</span>,0.6944874320000001,0.23397869]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If every student was helping out it could change attitudes which would help their level of effort to raise their grade point averages.
