Dear Mr. Principal</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that you should require all student to do a little community service, because of these three reasons.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">My first reason is that everyone should help out the community sometime it doesn't have to be a long hours, but doing so can build character.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">My second reason is that the community can benefit from this requirement if you put it into action.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">My third reason is most parents want student to help out around the house or neighborhood that can be classified as a sort of community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I hope I have enlightened you on my insight to this matter. Again my three main reasons were one, everyone should help out in the community at least a little bit. Two, the community can benefit from this requirement if you put it into action. Three, most parents want student to help out around their house or neighborhood and for most parents this would make them happy to know that students are contributing to the well being of the community. Thanks I hope you can come to a decision soon.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
