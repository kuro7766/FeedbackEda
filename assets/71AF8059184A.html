Dear State Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think we should get rid of the Electoral Collage vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">It's not fair that a majority of people get to vote extra.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">The candidate's get to choose people who will vote for the person who picked them just bc they picked them. They probbaly dont have good reasons on the they pick that candidate they just pick him/her because they picked that person. They candidate who did win the election their electorial voters get a przie just for helping them win the election. And the others well they get nothing. It's not fair to the other people who voted for their apponite. All they get is a "Thanks for voting". Presidents voters get a cerification for helping them when. It's not fair to everyone else</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:white">Sometimes they candidate they picked to win isn't even a good presidant.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">They can't hold up to their side of the deal. the President says he/she will fix our economy and then the economy drops. They say they will prvovied a better education for students and they don't. Two electors from the same state can go to Congress. The candidates pick people from the states who know that the will vote for that specific candidates.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  I<span style="color:white">n 2000 campaign, in total, seventeen sates didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">In 25 of the largest media market a majority of voters did not go see any of the campaign ads.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Candidates will bribe voters and Electorial Collage voters just to vote for that candidate and not they other.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">It's not fair to the other candidte who plays by the book for losing to someone who goes around the book to get more votes just to be President.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Again I think we should get rid of the Elctorial Collage vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
