Cell Phone Policy</br></br>Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I am thinking about the policies for using cell phones at school. Since many students are using phones, they will of course want to use it at school. I surely know that all of the students would want Policy One, since it enables them to use their cell phones at break time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">That will mean there will be a less amount of phones being taken away during class, because they spent the time using their phones at break. Of course, the students cannot use their phones during class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I would agree with Policy One.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Using cell phones at break would decrease the amount of students using cell phones in class, since they used their break time to use it</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">That will lead to a decreasing number phones being taken away, and also a decreasing number of referrals and detention.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Letting the students using their cell phone during break and lunch time will lower the chance of fights.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It also could make the voice level go down, which will be a relief to the yard duties and other teachers.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I know Policy One will work for the students and staff, because if you don't let the students use their phone, they will try any single way, and use any spare time during classes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">That would end up in disaster</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">All of the students in this school will enjoy the time you will enable them to use their phones, and the school will be a happier place.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Thank you for your time to read my thoughts on what policy I think is better and right.
