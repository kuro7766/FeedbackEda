It is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. A difference would be a thick atmosphere. NASA's solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Humans are curious of what Venus is like.</br></br>In paragraph 4, Venus could have once had oceans. It could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. Venus today still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. It has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.178497291,<span style="color:white">0.7564126260000001</span>,0.0650900884]</span>  <span style="color:white">If scientists were able to study Venus, it would help us undertsnad the planet more.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1990021478</span>,0.757774208,0.0432236639]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It is hard to study Venus</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.1677920299999999,<span style="color:white">0.8173168260000001</span>,0.014891172]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide.

Venus is like Earth's twin. It is possible to humans to study this planet. NASA has ideas that will help find ways to study Venus. Technology can also help us in these experiments.
