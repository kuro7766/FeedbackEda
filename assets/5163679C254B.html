Dear principal, <span style="color:orange">personally, i don't think community service should be required</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> , because <span style="color:orange">if its not your thing your not going to want to do it and your not going to have fun doing it</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I don't think it is much fun to do but i do it with my church anyways. This year a am going to go down to LOCATION_NAME and i am going to help with community service things we well be doing is helping hand out food and helping plant and things people cant do by themselves. I have a lot of friends that do cool stuff like that too. But if you require it makes it sound more like homework, and then kids wont be so excited about it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think community service is about volunteering, if you want to volunteer and help out the community you should.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Another trip i' m doing this year or next is going to my sister church in Mexico and helping them out with a group from my church.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some kids don't have enough time there either to busy with sports or x box or something</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but they should still make some time to volunteer, even if its not huge, they could collect food for a food bank or something small</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">that's what i think about requiring community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
