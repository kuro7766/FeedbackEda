Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I think students should have the opportunity to do community service, but they shouldn't have to do it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">One reason I think community service shouldn't be required is because some students may play sports or be in a club or group and not have any time between school and their extracurricular activity to work in the community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br>Also <span style="color:yellow">if you make community service required many students may spend so much time on their community service they may lose the passion for the sport they enjoy so much.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br>Also <span style="color:yellow">the students that already do community service may do it for fun or they enjoy helping others, but they may not enjoy it if they are forced to do it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Personally i don't enjoy community service but I still do it by helping the elderly by fixing up their porches or building a ramp for them if they are confined to a wheelchair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Although I enjoy it I don't want to be made to do it.</br></br><span style="color:orange">I also think many people that do community service enjoy being with people and being social or environmentally friendly.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I know I am more of a social person so I like working for people that I can talk to about things they like to do and stuff I do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">also if you make people perform community service many students grades may go down because they are focusing on their community service time than their grades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
