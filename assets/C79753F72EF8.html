<span style="color:orange">If it was an object created by aliens then why would they turn that landform into a human face. There have never been any reports of someone coming close to an alien face to face. Also how would the aliens know what humans look like, they have never even been to earth before</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">All that face is, is a rock with shadows from the sun to make illusions to the human eye.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The face was used in grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  Yes, <span style="color:orange">you may think think aliens did it and there is a chance they did, but that chance is very slim</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">yes, some scientist did believe it was an alien artifact but that was before they had HD cameras and now we can see the rock clearly.
