Al Gore had a signifigant victory in popular vote for the nation, yet still was denied presidency due to the electoral college's vote assignment system. If we did away with the electoral college, each and every person would have an equal say, and would be equally important to the candidates.Â  Even source three agrees that the trust in our electors is occasionally betrayed, albiet rarely.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.001423569806,<span style="color:white">0.0711044788</span>,0.927471918]</span> </br></br>Currently, the candidates can completely ignore portions of our country. <span style="color:yellow">Republicans have a strongly biased voter base in the south - so much so that generally speaking, the Republicans never have a single rally or major ad. According source two, states like South Carolina almost never vote Democrat. It's so rare, that if you lost, you offended the group that has voted unquestioningly for your party since the system has been put into place. If the electoral college system didn't exist, the thirty percent of southern Democrats would have a say, which would make advertising and campaigning all over the country much more vital.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00222134945,0.0761140984,<span style="color:white">0.921664502</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college system also allows for an astonishing amount of corruption with no punishment</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0035609281199999,<span style="color:white">0.206289644</span>,0.790149422]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If a state manages to vote one hundred percent Democrat, rogue electors can still cast their vote for the Republican candidate - and this isn't against the rules.

Again, source three clearly states "and that trust is rarely betrayed."

That doesn't sound very democratic and fair to me. People begin to feel discouraged and that their vote doesn't count, and this is quite close to the being the case. Only one-half of elligable citizens voted in the 2012 election, which means that one half didn't. Half of our country isn't bothering to vote in the elections because the electoral college system completely negates their vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00266059328,0.097114527,<span style="color:white">0.9002248820000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Our country prides itself on being "the land of the free, and the home of the brave," yet our people are being discouraged at every turn by our government. The popular opinion of our people is that the government is out to get us, and there's not much evidence to contradict that. The electoral college system allows for the government to be run by men who didn't fairly win over our country, and isn't accurately representing our views. It's rife with corruption, and allows money to buy power. If we remove this system in favor of a popular vote election would encourage more popular policy, make our government closer to the people, and have little to no negative impact on our country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0010034674019999,0.0458714734,<span style="color:white">0.953125046</span>]</span>
