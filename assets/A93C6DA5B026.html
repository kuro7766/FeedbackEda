<span style="color:orange">The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by explaining and reasoning about Venus. Venus is a simple to see from the distant. Each previous mission was unmanned. Venus is a challenging planet and no spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.1270783628,<span style="color:white">0.8466679420000001</span>,0.0262537074]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I believe that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite of dangers</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.1418594,<span style="color:white">0.8441694359999999</span>,0.0139711395999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because it's a challenging place to examine more closely</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.178042268,<span style="color:white">0.8102496200000001</span>,0.01170812684]</span> , <span style="color:white">has different speeds</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.31519135</span>,0.677776084,0.0070325507799999]</span> , <span style="color:orange">and the atmosphere and heat</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.229690416,<span style="color:white">0.7611564399999999</span>,0.0091531413]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">Venus is sometimes called the "Evening Star," is one of the brightest points of the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.

Each previous missions was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. This issue explains why not a single spaceship had landed on Venus and numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.497629574,<span style="color:white">0.492107344</span>,0.01026308624]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.

Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Venus has many more experinces to go and finding out more about it. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be exapned to meet very edges of imagination and innovation. Venus can sometimes be worthy pursuit despite the dangers.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.17067239,<span style="color:white">0.7680334600000001</span>,0.0612941584]</span>
