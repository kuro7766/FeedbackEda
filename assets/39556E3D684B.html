Someone else might see something in a totally different way then you see it. They might show something that is completely obvious that you never saw. Better ideology and reasons might be received as well. Doing so opens up new possibilities for different ideas. Asking others for their opinion certainly gives multiple points of view.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0084679424599999,0.2742947192,<span style="color:white">0.7172373519999999</span>]</span> </br></br>Next, seeking advice can help make a better decision by allowing one to think about their decision thoroughly. <span style="color:yellow">This gives the person seeking advice more time to decide how they feel.

Not only will they feel appreciative, but they know that you care. They will feel involved with ones life. They also might ask for your advice one day knowing you asked them. Wanting someones opinion will prove to them that you care about them in many ways.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0383886447999999,0.444982318,<span style="color:white">0.5166290419999999</span>]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, seeking advice is strongly advised.
