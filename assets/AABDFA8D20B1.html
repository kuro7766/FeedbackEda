Driveless cars are so doubted for their safety that certain states have limited the use or banned them from being driven or tested in their state roads, a few states who have done this is Calforina, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. Driveless cars who notify people when to take over if the emergency are still not that safe as they have no effective to notify the driver that he should take over, many companies have tried different techniques but none of them have found an effective way to get the drivers attention in case the drivers needs to take over because the car cant handle the roads or sencario it is in. Without an effective way to get the drivers attention, to take over if the time is needed, the car can have an major accident because the driver attention was caught to take over the car and the car couldn't handle the situation, leading to an accident. Even with accidents the problems do not end their, many people and car manducatures and companies do not know if you blame the driver or the manfucaturing. With this not settled out, you getting in an accident because techonolgy an compnay has put in a car was incapable of handling safe driving could make you be blamed for the accident and making you pay alot of money to fix your car and damages while the company who put this faulty techonolgy in the car, walk away with no problems.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0027213761119999,0.0442151126,<span style="color:white">0.953063494</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Driveless cars are dangerous and can be hazardous to the driver and the people around the driver and also leave you to deal with the consequences of an accident.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00287485756,0.185322245,<span style="color:white">0.811802868</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Driveless may seem cool at first, being able to drive all by thereself and not needing the help of any real person but what does that do to the driver.

This has been a big problem for car companies as they have to get people to buy their car and enjoy the ride and the car and companies do not know how to do that. Werner Huber who is the BMW project manger said that with cars being able to drive by themselves they have to find new ways to attract and make the costumers enjoy the car and they can not find a way to do that without putting the driver adn the passengers at risk. The only things they have founded to make the car enjoyable to drive with driveless cars is entrainment systems or texting but all these may be enjoyable to the driver but also puts the driver at risk.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0158564503,0.2510841472,<span style="color:white">0.73305941</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Driveless cars are cars that are suppose to be able to drive by themselves with nobodies assitance but that is not true.

One of the most technonlgical advances car made by BMW, is a driveless car and is suppose to be driveless car but is it really, the car can only handles speeds up to 25 miles per hour and any faster and the driver has to take over and even when the car is driving itself the driver needs to keep his or her hands on the steering wheel.

These cars can cause accidents, can not deal with hard driving, and can leave you with the consequnces of a horrible accident. Driveless cars might sound amazing and awesome part of the future but it is an negative aspect of the automotive industry and letting that negative aspect get s foothold in the future will be disatorous.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.00787585494,0.354021834,<span style="color:white">0.6381023259999999</span>]</span>
