Dear Mr principal,</br></br>I think <span style="color:orange">students are require to take community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because it <span style="color:orange">helps them get organized</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . It also <span style="color:orange">helps out the community to be more cleaner.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  For example <span style="color:orange">doing community service helps kids stay out of trouble such as gangs, violence, and drugs.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  Also <span style="color:white">it helps kids to be more disciplined, more respectful, more caring for our planet, more careful, more safe, and more mature</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . One Example is that kids who do community service are more organize. <span style="color:orange">Community service is helpful to kids that get bored at home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Sometimes people think that doing community service is just a waste of time because they don't want to do it or they think that it is just boring. But community service can show you new things. Such as taking care for the elderly, taking care of the planet, respecting others, and helping others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  One last thing about community service is that it makes our community look more better than others, and it helps our community to be better for the people that live in our community. <span style="color:orange">Those are my reasons on why our school should do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
