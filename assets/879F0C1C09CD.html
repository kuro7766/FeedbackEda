And again they might even get an even bettere and bigger because of the technology we have today. It might be even in high definition so that they can see if thats actually a face or if its just a mountain with craters. But they might get me wrong and thats ok but as long as they have a better camera to explain how or what i'm right about. Like in the beginning of this article it said that they had take pictures in 1976, 1998, and in 2001 but all of those pictures are on cameras that make pictures blury and in order to see if the picture was actually a face they had to do something to make that picure clearer than it shows.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.294443278,0.6923571540000001,<span style="color:white">0.0131995888</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They might argue that im wrong because they might say that why will they need the technology and they might say like well we already have a picture and its a face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.245098572,<span style="color:white">0.751229982</span>,0.00367146612]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But it could possibly be something else.

And if aliens really did it then we need to get nother camera up there and see if there is any other life out there. Then the person who is asking that question would say "havent you guys already put one up there and theres nothing". Then I would come back and say then why do you think that aliens did it if we got nothing on the cameras that we sent up there. So he would be kind of wrong if we dont have any evidence that aliens are out there.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.404187678,<span style="color:white">0.591604754</span>,0.00420755868]</span>
