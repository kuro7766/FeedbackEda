I understand why elector are trying to stay there trying to stay to have a sucessful carrer and do good in life and not be a bum that live on the street or working at mcdonalds. Another good reason is that if it turn into a tie then the house or representatives come into place and they put the thoughts into. A reason to be it unfair the electoral collehe get no credit for what happens they should get alittle for all the hard work they put into. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect the president. Who are the elector? They can be anyone not holding public office.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.8745872480000001</span>,0.12451976,0.0008929702979999]</span>
