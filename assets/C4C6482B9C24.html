<span style="color:white">Venus, sometimes called the "Evening star" it is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky that is amazing. Well Venus is actually a planet.</br></br>Venus is called the "Evening star" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. In our solar system Venus is the second planet from our sun. While Venus is simple from the distant but safe vantage point of earth it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closley. Often referred to as Earth"twin" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and occcasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Marsour other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times in Venus. Maybe this is issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than threendecades. Numerous factors contribute to Vensu reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.922747668</span>,0.0762110254,0.00104127795]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion this is why it is worthly to study about Venus.
