Also you can get to know animals and lear ablout animals, too. So this will help you if you plan to work with animals when you grow up. You get to travel to new and incredible places that you haven't been to before. If that does not grab your attention then I still have more to tell you how amazing this would be! "The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy." Stated Luke. Luke had fun you would, too. If you think you had fun working with the animals on the boat, just think about what incredible things you do when you unload all the animals. Well I will tell you what they do. The cowboys play baseball, and volleyball, boxing, fencing, and so many other games when there are no animals on the ship. This is also a good time to get to know people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.177476407,<span style="color:white">0.6867652059999999</span>,0.135758376]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So do you think that you are going to join now?
