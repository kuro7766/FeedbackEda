Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">According to the articles and arguements given I think the most effective way to get a premeire president for our nation is vote on the behalf of the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">In my view of the Electoral College has more experience aswell as having a sense of quality and values that they know can change the country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> <span style="color:orange">If we depend on the popular vote of the country,only in the favor of the people classes and opinions of the people, it may lead to presidents that cant maintain order of his or her country.Nonethless,the votes of both Electoral College and majority vote is basically as lucky as a flip of a coin,one side may lead to ultimate failure and the depression of a country the other may lead to momentous uprising of the country,in chosing the right leader of the country.Although, based on the criteria I just created is really puzzling your mind about what president is best I believe that the Electoral College may clear things up and make the best decision in favor of the people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Based on the articles,the Electoral College does knows best</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">because although they lack of democratic pedigree doesnt mean there wont be democrats in the whitehouse, because they have requirements of how to find the best fit no matter what party included.Even if they were unsupportive of the democrats Romney lossed as example of equality of parties on the College's choice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> <span style="color:orange">The articles also state that no popular votes determine the election of a president</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">showing that although more than half of the population in the nation picks a candidate it wont matter unless that candidate gets a majority vot of the Electoral College aswell</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .<span style="color:white">Stating that the expierience of the College will prevail on the birth of a new president,no matter what party,no matter the odds of a popularity vote, the Electoral College is a perfect example of this nation's motto because they are truely a sign of equality between candidates that might become great presidents of our nation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,PROPER_NAME
