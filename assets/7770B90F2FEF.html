<span style="color:yellow">Imagine a lost, confused version of yourself. Perhaps it's an essay, a project, or a personal situation that has you conflicted. You have no idea what to do or what to think of. You are stuck. The first thing that pops into your head is to consult your peers, but not just one.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.00313427134,0.1244635392,<span style="color:white">0.8724021719999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Asking for advice from more than one person has many upsides.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.00657923914,0.267800994,<span style="color:white">0.72561975</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">You can see what others think of your situation,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00433336494,0.216966316,<span style="color:white">0.7787003560000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">there can be many different thoughts.

For example, if you had a ton of homework, there are many different things that people could suggest. Do the hardest things first, do the easiest things first, or just wait until the next day to complete it all. They all have different opinions, but you can get it all from just asking multiple people for advice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.00607467574,<span style="color:white">0.182368152</span>,0.811557174]</span> </br></br>However, some people may have better ideas than others. <span style="color:yellow">Not all advice given is automatically good. Let's say, for example, you are planning to redecorate your bedroom. Someone offers a neon-yellow pillow for your chair. You think to yourself, no way . Someone else tells you to hang up squares cut out from cardboard around the border of the entrance. You think, huh, that's not such a bad idea , until you ask one more person. They suggest that you declutter your shelf and invest in new curtains for a clean and bright look. Brilliant! The third suggestion is far better than the rest.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00952477756,0.1489702672,<span style="color:white">0.841504954</span>]</span> </br></br>Lastly, it is crucial that you consider a different perspective other than your own. <span style="color:orange">Consulting others for advice can help you do that. Perhaps your situation isn't as horrible as you thought, maybe it could be easily fixed and dealt with. People other than yourself can help you see the good things in bad situations. You could have this sense of relief from just consulting someone for their opinion. Simple as that!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.00852312362,<span style="color:white">0.2182182199999999</span>,0.773258652]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Asking more than one person for advice is critical. You can see what others think, receive many different opinions that are better than the others, and view your dilemma in a new perspective. After all of that, your situation could seem easier to understand and not so terrible as you thought. Asking just one person for their thoughts is a mistake, do not forget to ask another!</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.00190651672,0.1124856992,<span style="color:white">0.88560778</span>]</span>
