From personal experience, I've learned that most students don't enjoy being forced to do something. Being told what to do and when to do it, makes the learning environment more stressful for students. Therefore, the more freedom students have the less stress they'll receive. At school, students have some unreasonable consequences. If students did online learning, they would benefit from not having as many consequences. Student would benefit from having less consequences. Therefore, students should have the right to their freedom, especially when it comes to what they're learning.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0461680331,<span style="color:white">0.624044724</span>,0.32978724]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also, students would feel more comfortable and enjoy online classes</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0628226386,<span style="color:white">0.7626231539999999</span>,0.1745542279999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The average student, plays sports or does extracurricular activities, making their schedule more difficult. Online school would provide students with a more flexible schedule. Students would also be able to do and try new things outside of the classroom. Activities keep students engaged, making them want to learn. This also makes learning more fun and helps students further their learning. The less stress students have the more successful they'll be. Students can't have fun with what they're learning if they're stressed. Having a lot of stressful causes students to not do well in school. For some students, stress can be helpful, but for the average high school student stress isn't beneficial and cause more issues for students. Students should be able to have fun and enjoy their learning for their benefit.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.03604497248,<span style="color:white">0.5471704479999999</span>,0.416784556]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Others may say online school isn't beneficial</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1552374</span>,0.75343976,0.0913227913999999]</span> , <span style="color:orange">but students are going to pay more attention and have less stress</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.1144865281999999,<span style="color:white">0.766975442</span>,0.1185380074]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Students already don't enjoy the idea of coming to school everyday, and being told what to do and how to act. Some of the rules at school can be unreasonable for students causing students to get into more trouble. Online classes would take away that trouble.
