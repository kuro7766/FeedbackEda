Students have a lot of homework to do from different teachers. For an example students are given a lot of homework and have chores to do at home like cleaning clothes, taking care of their pets, cleaning the house or taking care of their siblings. Some students are already tired from school and might not want to participate in any other activity because they have to wake up early for school and have to do school work really early even though science say that the human brain starts working correctly when it's ten in the morning so that means the human brain of a middle school might not work so well at six or seven in the gosh darn morning.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0817323732,0.681725212,<span style="color:white">0.2365424128</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I disagree with the principal that every student must participate in an activity because not everyone is sporty, want to stay inside and do the yearbook or serve on the student council.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0830640119999999,<span style="color:white">0.8442321680000001</span>,0.0727038351999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some kids just want to go home and relax a bit after doing work at school or some just want to play games to realest their stress of school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0914494206,<span style="color:white">0.8343554860000001</span>,0.074195084]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think that students don't need to participate an any sort of activity that has to do with school because people want their minds off of school and not have to worry so much about it. Kids just wanna have fun out of school and don't want to do anything school related. Well most kids don't want anything to do with school once they get home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.19660491,<span style="color:white">0.7813482480000001</span>,0.022046855]</span>  As I was saying before I got intruded by my brain bring up memes while writing this. <span style="color:white">I think that the principal should not decided that every single gosh darn student should do an extracurricular activity.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.295023474</span>,0.697789454,0.0071870646799999]</span>  Maybe everyone should take a nap for a few minutes...sorry! I'm very tired for some reason so anyways that's what I think about the principal's choice. Many students don't want to participate in activities.
