Even if your just doing homework and it could tell that your upset or confused or just bugged out by the problem it could help you without even asking fo9r help it would help you out right away i think thats coool cause alot of kids need help on stuff like that and for teachers they cant help alot of students with work. So before the teacher even gets to them the computer could be helping them alreadfy its like a teaher thats already there and lord knows every student wants that extra help to pass.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2221941292,<span style="color:white">0.762009394</span>,0.01579646936]</span>
