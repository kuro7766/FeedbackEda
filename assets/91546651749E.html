<span style="color:yellow">I can just imagine how the near future ahead may look. From time to time I ask my great grandmother questions about the life she had growing up and im always amazed by the comaparison to the life that I live. I have grown up with technology at my fingertips, techonology from the alarm that wakes me up to the music I listen to on my ipod when I go to sleep. Growing up I don't remember getting lost and having to ever ask for direcions when traveling out of state with my family. We simply used our GPS system. I like watching movies on the car when we go places, and I life the rear camara on the car that helps us drive safely. These new techonologies have made our lives much easier and thanks to those bright minds that have created and innovated the techonlogy we have.</br></br>As time goes by, we as a society must make progress, and its clear that we have. Along with progress comes some disagreements and possible dangers thanks to time and acceptace from our society we have made great improvements from, lets say the time my great grandma was just a young girl.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">From these I can say that when the question of driveless cars comes up I am all for it. I believe that having to get inside a smart car that "could drive themselves", is not a bad thing or idea at all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">"In the 1980's auto makers used speed secors in the creation of anti lock brakes.
