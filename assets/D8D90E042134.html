In my personal opinion, <span style="color:orange">I think that students should decide on their own</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.1188999989999999,<span style="color:white">0.841170906</span>,0.039929076]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I mean if they're eight-graders, they should be smart enough and decide on their own on what they want, or don't want to do</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.282164414,<span style="color:white">0.701928924</span>,0.0159066489]</span> . <span style="color:orange">For me, I would choose helping the community, 'cause if you think about it, your actually doing it for your own goods, maybe in some points your not, but most of them from peoples personal experiment's basically, your doing it for your community and your country, the world and people that are around you</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0856558168,<span style="color:white">0.749263556</span>,0.165080635]</span> . <span style="color:orange">What i would do, I would make a list from easiest, to hardest on helping the community, and start from the easiest because at first, your not used to it, and you need to learn how to be responsible for your things, and for what you do</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1347929927999999,<span style="color:white">0.768657434</span>,0.0965495882]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">For example, I'll pick, helping students in your classrooms. Then, I might start tutoring my cousins or neighbors, something to start of with, like a practice. If I'll see or think that I'm good enough, I might move on, tutoring Elementary kids. Later on, I'll be a famous tutor! If I'll be doing a good job at tutoring, I might starting subbing for teachers, then they'll ask me to be a teacher! Which means, that now I'll have a job! So basically, I made my own personal carrier just for helping the community!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.149980183,0.623874986,<span style="color:white">0.2261448464</span>]</span>  What I'm trying to say, <span style="color:white">helping you community isn't as bad</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.270956886</span>,0.7191427380000001,0.00990039296]</span> . If your one of the lucky ones, you'll make your self a carrier, if not, keep on trying! And one important thing to no is, keep on trying, what you give, is what you'll receive.
