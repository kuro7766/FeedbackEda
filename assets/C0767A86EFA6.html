<span style="color:white">My opinion is that we should study venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Yes, it might be dangerous</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but if you would want to find out more about venus then that's the option.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">"Researches cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance." We wouldn't be able to see it far away.

"Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite it's proximity to us." Venus is the hottest even if it's not the closest to the sun. "Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Studying venus would be much better.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">We would know more about venus and it is. We would know what it has and what don't it have. "Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system." Some of venus features are unknown but some are analogous to those on earth. "NASA's possible solution to the hositle conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">"Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky." Venus is the second planet from our sun. We are curious what venus has and study it. It has so many things that earth dosen't. It's a whole different planet. "NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It might be dangerous but one day we will get to go to venus. NASA is trying there hardest to get a person to venus but we need more materials and money for that. Almost 3 decades we haven't went to venus. It's a challenge to study and get back. NASA will complete this challenge.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
