Venus's atmosphere at night is not affected by carbon dioxide of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. This is exactly why studying Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky is simple for an amateur stargazer to spot.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.575159884,<span style="color:white">0.395605604</span>,0.02923454312]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.229995292,<span style="color:white">0.7316531079999999</span>,0.0383516044]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Venus has value because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself just like intimidating endeavors does as well.</br></br>Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, it should only be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.</br></br>This helps to strive to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.51420864</span>,0.471500566,0.0142907832399999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So, because our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts, intimidating endeavors should only be expanded to meet the imagination and innovation of the travel.</br></br>So, because Venus is simple to see from the distant and because our travels should be expanded, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it only presents a small amount of dangers.</br></br>So, If Venus was more of a dangerous planet to explore, walk on, and study, would this be a planet that everyone would be interested to study and afraid to walk on to explore?</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.226604468,<span style="color:white">0.6913496040000001</span>,0.0820459258]</span>
