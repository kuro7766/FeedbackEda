Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I have a idea for the community service for students. I am speaking on behalf of 93 % of the students as well, or close to that percentage. You may not agree with this ideas but all I ask of you is to hear me out and give them a chance. I am we can come to a agreement for the students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think we should have the students only have to do community service two or three times a week</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">For two or three weeks until the next groups does there service. Each group should have five or six students in it and they will do certain things together.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Once there weeks are up a next group comes in and this cycle wont repeat until a 2 months later. So I am asking we skip one month of community service. so we go a month skip a month then go a month and skip a month and so on.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I know this idea will go well with many students. Plus the service they do will get over before to late so they can get home and do any home work and any of there own things</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">Please try and give this idea a chance Principal.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Your friend,</br></br>Student Council Leader STUDENT_NAME
