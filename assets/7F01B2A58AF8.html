Dear State Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">We have a big conflict containing the electoral college, Im debating on what we should do</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Im all in favor for keeping the electoral college, Instead of going by the most popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The most popular vote can be very difficult because the citizens that are voting are just choosing mostly perhaps they dont even know whats going on.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They choose based on favoritism and that shouldnt be the case, when you're choosing something so important like this, you have to know the facts about that person and what they're willing to do for us as a whole. Theres a million reasons why the most popular vote shouldn't be even recommended for this, its unnecissariy It should never be based on favoritism its about what they bring to the table.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college is widely known as an anachronism.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">I have my opinion they have theres, their gonna give you opinions  about how unfair the electoral college is when in reality its not anything thats gonna harm you. Perhaps i think its safer then choosing someone that you have no idea about the decisions they wanna make. Yes people may no be that much interested in politics because their not involved that much. They have to do whatever it takes so our nation can be a great one.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Leaving our nation in someone hands that doesnt really know what their doing is completely absurd. Do you know how bad that will make our nation look if we had one? I would be ashamed to claim this as my "Home".</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
