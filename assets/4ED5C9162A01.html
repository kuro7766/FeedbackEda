Dear Mr. Principal</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think it would be a good thing for us teens to do community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">it will give us something to do after school of stand of going home doing nothing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  I also think that <span style="color:orange">we should have field trips going to homeless neighbor hood and helping teens ,kids ,and other people</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  it would be really fun.</br></br><span style="color:orange">We should go and serve them food and give them toys , gifts, clothes, and shoes. We should also try to take them to Disney land or castle park some where they can have fun and see things they never saw.</br></br>Well my friends don't think it will be fun but i think it will be a really good time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  I think <span style="color:orange">they should give us a grade on community service because when they get home nothing to do all they do is get on the phone call their friends and eat and watch television.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  So that's why i think it would be a good thing to do. So that's why i think we should do community service i think it will be really fun to do. i hope really get a chance to do something like this cause it looks really fun. <span style="color:orange">This one more reason it would help the family's that really need it</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and that's what community service is about. <span style="color:white">That's why we should do it would help us on are school recorder.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
