Computers are already taking over a lot of things, but when it comes to humans we should´t need a computer to tell us how were feeling. Computers and technology aren´t 100% right, only you would know exactly how your feeling.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.147187222,<span style="color:white">0.8408809180000001</span>,0.0119318598199999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion computers shouldn´t be allowed to read students expression. In paragraph 5 Dr. Huang says it isn´t hard to tell whether a friend is feeling happy or sad you should be able to read that, so why exactly do we need a computer doing that? Some things us humans should be able to figure out because its our body and we know how it works. Therefore we shouldn´t need technology going pass our personal boundaries and telling us how we feel . It would just cause more conflict and more wasted money on things we ca just figure out ourselves.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1144362447999999,<span style="color:white">0.8567565800000001</span>,0.0288071765]</span>
