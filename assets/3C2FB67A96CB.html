It could help in somecases like when a child is being bulllied at school and they dont tell someone then the teacher could use the device to see that the child is either sad or mad or even both.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.180034828,<span style="color:white">0.805554198</span>,0.0144109625999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I support and do not support this at ther same time. i support it because I feel it could be helpful but I do not suppot this because I feel if a child needs help with how they are feeling they will go to an adult they trust, weather it be a teacher at school or a parent or even a friend at achool.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.333864252</span>,0.6618270340000001,0.00430870424]</span>
