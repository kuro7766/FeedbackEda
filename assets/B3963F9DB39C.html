<span style="color:white">"Just be fair" quotes many people everyday. In the article "Does the Electoral College Work?" Source 1: "What Is the Electoral College" by the Office of the Federal Rgister, Source 2: "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer, and Source 3: "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span> " <span style="color:orange">I think that the Electoral College should be abolished and to elect a president by popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The first thing to remember, is that the Electoral College is unfair and needs to be changed to the popular vote because the people should be able to vote who they want to be president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The author mentions in Source: 3 paragraph 18 that "A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote." This proves that with the Electoral College in place that there may be a big contreversy about who should be the next president. Arguments would also break out between the political parties that are trying to elect their canidate president. With popualar vote you could avoid all these conflicts and disputes by letting the people elect the president outright with no questions</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">With this in mind, there should be no Electoral College because the author suggests in Source 3: paragraph 19 that "The Electoral College requires a presidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pularity in states that he knows he will win." A presidential canidate should be able to gain votes from his region because that is the states the canidate are more familiar with so, he will be able to campaign better in those states and if he becomes president he will be equal to all the other regions. You could avoid this with the fair method of popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Another key point, is that the number of votes coming from each state should be equal in the amount of votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The author claims in Source 2: paragraph 10 that "If you lived in Texas for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would vote for a slate of 34 electors pledged to Kerry. With popular vote you would not have to worry about all of the votes that each state gives from the Electoral College. Popular vote lets the people deside no the Electoral College deside. If two canidates were running for president and one was from Florida and the other one was from Alaska, their state could be the deciding factor which the one from Florida will win because it has more votes than Alaska which is not fair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Truly, the Electoral College should be replaced by popular vote because there is a winner-take-all system.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The author shadows in Source 1: paragraph 7 that "Most states have a "winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of "proportional representation." The thing is that with a popular vote system you would not have to worry about a winner-take-all and states that have a different system than the other states. Just let the people decide and everything will be easy and fair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">On the flip side, the Electoral College should not be replaced because it avoids any type of run-off election that may occur.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The author argues in Source 3: paragraph 22 that "The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in wich no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast." This shows that with the Electoral College it would relieve all of the stress that is put on a canidate when they are running and the stress could also complicate the process of electing the president. With the Electoral College their will be a winner no matter what happens which will clearly the most fair way to complete the process of electing the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">To conclude, after analyzingÂ the article "Does the Electoral College Work?"
