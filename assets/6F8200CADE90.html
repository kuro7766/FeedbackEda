Each student have the own facial expression is compared aginst a neutral face showing no emotion in a student face. A machine that will let you know if a student is borde or confused is good but that's why we have are own voice to let our teacher know that we need help.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.38568573,<span style="color:white">0.6109052580000001</span>,0.00340899918]</span>
