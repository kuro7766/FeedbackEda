Dear state senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Im in favor of keeping the electoral college. This process might take a while but not as much as election by popular votes for the president of the united states.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.127268841,<span style="color:white">0.8537133520000001</span>,0.01901781046]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The election by popular vote is saying that the electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.1537896088,<span style="color:white">0.8370986740000002</span>,0.00911171504]</span> . <span style="color:white">Well I think its not, it's widely regarded as a thing that seems to belong to the past but also not to fit in the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.383179642</span>,0.611274122,0.00554623302]</span>  <span style="color:white">The electors are the ones who elect for the president not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate we're basically voting for a slate of electors.

Also under the amendment of the constituation, the district of Columbia is allocated three elctors and treated like a state of purposes of the electral college. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Unlike the others. They just vote by how big the state is and by how many repesenitives there are.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.654210272</span>,0.341625242,0.00416449205]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electors are picked by depending on the states which makes it fair enough.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.220510241,<span style="color:white">0.769252406</span>,0.01023733576]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Back then the louisiana legislature barley succeeded in getting rid of and getting new democratic electors.
