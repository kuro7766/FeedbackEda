Think of what would happen if you go with the second policy, students will try and talk to friends during your teachers classes. When the students use there cell phones in classes they worry more about number one, getting caught and number two being able to talk to there friends</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0999186879999999,<span style="color:white">0.858100638</span>,0.0419806898]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Most schools worry that students that have internet capability will post mean things about other students on social networking sites.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.067397428,<span style="color:white">0.8985965300000001</span>,0.0340060374999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">You cant stop students from posting it at there homes, so they will do it there instead so you cant prevent that from happening.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2350156691999999,<span style="color:white">0.758960032</span>,0.00602429462]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If you select the alternative policy, and not the first policy than students would not be allowed to have them of use at school at all</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.1759449386,<span style="color:white">0.813463442</span>,0.0105916029]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If they were not to be of use than students would make it a game or a competition to see who can text the longest without getting caught by the teacher.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.23256018,<span style="color:white">0.7609866719999999</span>,0.00645316922]</span>  <span style="color:white">It would be better to have them at use in school because than students that want to learn can and the students that don't want to learn repeat the same classes until they pay attention enough to pass there class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.262074336</span>,0.729776106,0.00814959016]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Not being able to have a cell phone out at any time of the school day would be a bad idea.
