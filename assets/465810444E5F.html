Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">Due to the fact that we live in America, where we have the choice of choosing what we would like to do, (most of the time), I due believe that students should have the right to choose weather or not they want to participate in community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">I do, however, want to sate the fact that if we do choose to do community service that our world would be a much better place.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I don't, however, believe in forcing people to do something they don't have to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">On the other hand. if we do community service, we would get jobs done much faster.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For example, lets say we helped out at the pound and the it was overflowing with dogs.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">If we helped out the people, it wouldn't only be a nice thing to do, but you could get some benefits as well.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Maybe they'd offer you a job or you may just feel good about helping your fellow community members.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Another example is cleaning up trash on the highway, or anywhere really</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">That trash will add up and become a huge heap of trash. It's not healthy for you. the plants, or the animals. just imagine what could happen if a small animal ate something that was toxic to them. That wouldn't be good at all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">So just keep in mind that community service is a great thing to do, but if some people don't want to, you shouldn't force them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective]</span> </br></br>STUDENT_NAME
