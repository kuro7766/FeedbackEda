INTRODUCTION:</br></br><span style="color:white">venus is a big planet, sometimes is called "evening star", is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. In our solar system, venus is the second planet from our sun.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.653581064</span>,0.344239458,0.0021794782499999]</span> </br></br>BODY:</br></br><span style="color:orange">Venus is a secons planet with more similarity in our solar system, in terms of density an size and occasionally in distance. venus is a big planet for to go investigate</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.576475024,<span style="color:white">0.421056482</span>,0.00246848924]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets venus.</br></br>on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather than waht we experience on our own planet.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2989594319999999,<span style="color:white">0.6958710480000001</span>,0.00516948034]</span>  <span style="color:orange">These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.2393892159999999,<span style="color:white">0.755935582</span>,0.0046752126]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.482486306,<span style="color:white">0.5152477020000001</span>,0.00226598794]</span>  <span style="color:orange">NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.361285168,<span style="color:white">0.636323692</span>,0.00239112194]</span> , <span style="color:orange">for example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surfaces and have lasted for three weeks i such conditions.
