In the text it states that Dr. Huang and Dr. Nicu are coming together to increase better communication between computers and humans. "are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate". These two master minds are making sure readers know every step by step it takes to create this software without doing any harm. For example "computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the faces; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles". Meaning the software must reflect off a human like body or it wouldn't function correctly. "Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit". After the doctors finds out what it takes for the software to be a sucess they then go deeper into networking with a psychologist. Reaching out to the creater of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) Dr. Paul Eckman. Knowing that this software isn't basic Eckman simply starts out with the software using only the six basic emotions, which are happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness.
