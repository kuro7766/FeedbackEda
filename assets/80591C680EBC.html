<span style="color:orange">Many people believe the face on Mars is an extraterrestrial being. Although it may seem true, the face is a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There are many facts to show this is a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Many scientists have seen this face as life on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists have said there is life on Mars,and NASA is trying to hide it from the people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">In 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over the face, but they revealed there was no face to be seen. There was only a natural landform. Scientists have began to lose hope of ever seeing the face again. If they were ever able to find the face again, they would have money to do more investigation. Although there were no extratrrestrial beings, people still believed the face would soon appear again. Scientists are still trying to look for ways to explain it all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Reasearchers are still looking for the face on Mars. Scientist Jim Garvin states, "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes an the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were !"</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">He is comparing airplanes, pyramids,and small shacks to the face which is no longer there. This statement proves that the face is a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Many landforms on Earth form then after years or even decades, they decay down to nothing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Although landforms are always forming, they are also being destroyed. Without oxygen on Mars, there is no way the face is able to survive.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Although the face is not real and is a natural landform, researchers will stop at nothing to prove it is real. Conspiracy theorists are still trying to find the truth. Little do they know the truth has been revealed, the face is just a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
