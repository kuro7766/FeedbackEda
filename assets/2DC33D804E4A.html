<span style="color:orange">The auther suggedts that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. I agree with the author, studying Venus could be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presests. Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot, and the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. "Venus, sometimes called the 'Evening Star', is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot"(Paragraph 1)."Often referred to as Earth's 'twin', Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distant"(Paragraph 2). However, I think studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.380042982,<span style="color:white">0.5927316919999999</span>,0.0272253199999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I have couple reasons why I think studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.287443816,<span style="color:white">0.695547128</span>,0.01700905112]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">First of all, about 97 percent of a thick atmosphere blankets Venus are carbon dioxide.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.316976322</span>,0.659254898,0.02376877674]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is working on study about the planet, Venus.
