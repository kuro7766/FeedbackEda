Dear principal,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I understand your reasoning for the new change you would like to undertake, but I am against his issue. Many students in our school love to play sports, and other fun activities, but also many students are getting C averages or below as their grades</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.00902476048,0.278265972,<span style="color:white">0.71270928</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Kids that are doing so for example should not be restricted from school activities like so just because of their grades, the should be helped.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.01492359576,0.375618264,<span style="color:white">0.60945814</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">A possible solution is requiring the child stay after school for extra help with teachers, or if that is not possible, encourage small help sessions in class. A child may not be the brightest in school, but may be the best on the basketball team. It is not fair to them to take away something that is amusing for them, or lets them have fun. Their struggling with school isn't going to change if you just take away more privileges. The child needs help. And what i believe may happen is sometimes the child will even start doing worse, or stop focusing as much because he/she is angry and sad they have no privileges other than to focus on their school work more and try harder</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.02032585994,0.2865457999999999,<span style="color:white">0.693128372</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Most of these reasons are to occur if you take these activities away from children with averages of a C or less. On the other hand, if you start having after school sessions, then the child will start to succeed, and will be having fun participating in their activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0435408412,0.654743166,<span style="color:white">0.3017160012</span>]</span>  I greatly believe that this problem should be undertaken by these possible ways and strategy's.</br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>A concerned student
