Also on paragraph 7 the author states that when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia ,they found out that "the face" was just a regular natural landform. In the year of 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor was able to snap a picture of the landform, as said by Garvin</br></br>"the picture actually showed the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa- landforms common around the American West"</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.2359726499999999</span>,0.733843222,0.0301841507999999]</span> . <span style="color:white">I don't think the landform is an ancient artifact or any alian artifact i just think its a normal landform that happens to look like a human or alian face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.0887941512</span>,0.8913464400000001,0.0198594]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Even if Nasa was lying to us the landform benefits Nasa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.362672758,<span style="color:white">0.6322921600000001</span>,0.0050350900999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When they first snapped the photograph and shared it with the public it received alot of public attention.
