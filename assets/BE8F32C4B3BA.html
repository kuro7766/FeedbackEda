If we just have the elction just be based off votes and not popular party it would be messy. <span style="color:white">The Electoral College System allows certainity of outcome. No run-off election because mostly likely there will be no tie. No arguing about the president being from a certain place or region so that state favors the president. Winner-takes-all system allows the people to pay close attention to the election. Swing states allow a little excitement during the election because some states like Florida you don't know which way they are going to go.Â  Big states also like Florida gets the president on the edge because the can loose every small state and still win with the big ones.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.260057852</span>,0.6775629,0.0623792304]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">270 votes are not a lot of votes to win an elction with, but every vote counts.
