Unmasking the face on Mars??</br></br>Face on Mars??? <span style="color:orange">The face on mars is just a natural landform</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">Mars has plenty of landforms and its normal for landforms to creat a shape or face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Just because it makes a face on a planet doesn't mean aliens had anything to do with it. Under paragraph 5 you see a photograph of the face and many landforns surrounding it, so as you can see many landforms stand out on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In paragraph 3 it says (shadoes gave the landform eyes,a mouth,and nose)</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">so its a landform with a face but the shadows make up the face. NASA has been studying this for a long time,but for what ?, as you bcan see its just a landform not a face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In paragraph 7 it clearly says(thousands of web surfers were waiting when the image on the JPL website but when it appeared it revealed just a natural landform.). There was no momument after all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So in conclusion with this evidence, you can clearly see that its just a landform and not a alien monument.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
