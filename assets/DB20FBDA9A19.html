As mentioned earlier, drivers would still have to be alert while driving these supposedly "driverless" cars, they would have to worry about whether it was their fault or the cars fault for an accident, and lawmakers would have to determine if these cars are safe enough to be driven on public roads. WIthout a doubt there will be driverless cars in the twenty-first century, but hopefully by that time, the pros will outweigh the cons.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0239613836,0.49256608,<span style="color:white">0.483472528</span>]</span>
