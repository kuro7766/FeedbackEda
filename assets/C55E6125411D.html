Honestly.</br></br>Imagine this, a school full of kids crashing into each other... <span style="color:orange">A mess of supplies on the floors every where. Do you want that responsibility of being the janitor at the end of the day? Think of the law suites for even thinking about allowing this in school. I shudder at that thought. People will regret it to a point were they won't even think about bringing cell phones to school. Don't do it, or your going to be digging your own grave.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.153648454,<span style="color:white">0.7866597719999999</span>,0.0596917842]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Think of all the homework assignments left undone because student are to busy talking to even care</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0479506198,<span style="color:white">0.84481812</span>,0.1072312504]</span> . <span style="color:orange">All of the failed tests because no one studied, not giving a hoot. The school shutting down, kids being moved to a different school. And who's fault was it? Yours. I like school, I know it is rare, but please... no cell phones! I want to see my teachers again. Day after day, have some pity on one child.
