Honestly.</br></br>Imagine this, a school full of kids crashing into each other... <span style="color:orange">A mess of supplies on the floors every where. Do you want that responsibility of being the janitor at the end of the day? Think of the law suites for even thinking about allowing this in school. I shudder at that thought. People will regret it to a point were they won't even think about bringing cell phones to school.
