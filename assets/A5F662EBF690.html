Dear, State senator <span style="color:orange">we should keep the Electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">The college is a process,not a place. The process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice. The counting of electoral voters by congress. State's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The college is widely regarded as an anachronism. The Electoral college despite its lack of Democratic Pedigree.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">We shouldnt have to change to election by popular vote for President. The Electoral college looks like a big help to President. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president. The collge has many electors.270 electoral voters is required to elect the president.</br></br>Under 23rd amendemnt of constitution district of columbia is allocated 3 electors</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">It could be arugues the Electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters. There may be a few things i dont agree with about the Electoral college.

Many good things the college does.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">State Senator, We should keep the Electoral college.
