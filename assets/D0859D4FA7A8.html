Having rocky surfaces, sediments and mountains, this planet was most likely very close to earth long ago. The author states that the surface temperature reaches 800 degrees, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:white">Then the idea is brought up, what if we lived on Venus? Exploration of this planet has begun, and with profound dangers, scientists are still pursuing the idea.

"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us to many equally intimidating endeavours." Our exploration should not keep us from collecting data and finding things about our Earth and Solar System. The author explains, we need to meet the very edge of imagination and innovation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Venus has many dangers, seeming to make it impossible for humans or any life to survive. Despite all this, scientist continue to strive for planet exploration.
