Each time they went there has been no trace of aliens. Also NASA upgraded their camaras each time they went to Mars. So the pictures were more clearer.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">On the second mission NASA went on, the camaras proved it was a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Though other scientist belived alien markings were being hidden by wispy clouds.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This is because it was winter in Mars during the time NASA went.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Still NASA went on a third trip to make its point.

This couldn't be caused by aliens because Mars could've caused this landform to appear.

There is no evidence of aliens being on Mars. There is only fiction stories about it, and on radio talk shows. NASA has went on three missions to prove it's a natural landform, and they were'nt able to find alien markings. If this isn't enough evidenve to convince someone they must be a big alien fan.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
