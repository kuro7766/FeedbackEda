This is why its not a face but just a mesa</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.093812886,<span style="color:white">0.88712784</span>,0.0190592828]</span> .</br></br>Secondly NASA re-took photos of the "face". <span style="color:orange">In the picture its a lot clearer then the one took in 1976. They did this by using "New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry" to clear the picture up. This is another reason why its not a alien made object but a mesa</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0843043502,<span style="color:white">0.8858858700000001</span>,0.0298097826]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:white">Lastly it would be beneficial for NASA to say that it was aliens</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.229394542</span>,0.755610394,0.01499506224]</span> . <span style="color:white">it would beneficial to them because people would be giving more money to them to try and find the aliens. this is yet another reason why it's not aliens</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.439306928</span>,0.555760104,0.00493297372]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">To conclude these are the reasons why its not aliens. NASA would get more funding if they said it was aliens. They took a clearer picture of it in 2001 and it proved it wasnt a face. Lastly we have lots of mesas on Earth and someone siad theyd seen one like The Face on Mars by a river in Idaho</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0815511226,<span style="color:white">0.8965996479999999</span>,0.0218492442]</span> .
