<span style="color:orange">Summer break is a time for relaxation but, sometimes schools may assign students projects over the break. Thoughts of whether projects should be student or teacher designed have been tossed around. Some students of course would choose to do projects of their own choosing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.022073819,<span style="color:white">0.4384415459999999</span>,0.539484656]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In my opinion projects should be teacher designed</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0296181464,<span style="color:white">0.6158065899999999</span>,0.354575245]</span>  because <span style="color:yellow">there will be a higher chance of completion due to, a time frame,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00799479574,0.341748426,<span style="color:white">0.65025679</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">taking away pressure</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0136291089799999,0.423941604,<span style="color:white">0.562429308</span>]</span> , and <span style="color:yellow">a quenching of students thirst for knowledge.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.01335995134,0.4029428399999999,<span style="color:white">0.5836972059999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">When it comes to any type of work there is a time frame in which it needs to be completed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0112610346599999,0.353850702,<span style="color:white">0.634888252</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">When teachers assign students projects they are thought out and planned, if students are given the opportunity to design projects themselves especially over break there is the factor of procrastination. Teachers will assign students a project that is set in stone which will take away thoughts of changing the project over and over again which would lead to time loss. Teacher designed projects may not impact students summer break at all because, the student will know exactly what he or she has to do in order to complete project .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01391850818,0.306862894,<span style="color:white">0.6792185980000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Teacher designed projects also take pressure off the students</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0105022371,0.3915782059999999,<span style="color:white">0.59791958</span>]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Students may not know what kind of project will be worthy enough for a good grade and may second guess themselves. Some teachers have higher expectations for their students than others can which make some students feel pressured. Teacher designed projects will lower that feeling due to the fact students will not have to bend over backwards to create a project that will be enough to please his or her teacher.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0188513689199999,<span style="color:white">0.430388396</span>,0.550760238]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">People old and young have a thirst for knowledge students especially. Teachers may give students a project they know nothing about but the goal is for the student to keep learning while on break</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.01144242928,0.310402794,<span style="color:white">0.6781547619999999</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">When given a teacher designed project if the students have all the knowledge about the project, or not they will learn or discover new things. Projects require research which gives students the opportunity to discover tons of new information. Widening the students education and preparing them for next year. Student may pick an easy project that requires only prior knowledge which will keep them at same level of education they had before summer break. Which is why teacher designed projects will give students an opportunity to better themselves.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.02706388884,0.3506161719999999,<span style="color:white">0.622319958</span>]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, teacher designed projects are best for students. <span style="color:yellow">Some may argue that student designed projects will benifit the student more than a teacher designed project because of the chance of an easy grade.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.0139467328,0.4151719459999999,<span style="color:white">0.5708813239999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">When a teacher designed project will give students the opprotunity to widen their knowledge</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Effective/0.0444487496,0.629137342,<span style="color:white">0.326413885</span>]</span> .
