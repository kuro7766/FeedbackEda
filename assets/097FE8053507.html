You might spoil them if you're just telling them to play sports with their about-to-be-low-grade. They should make good grades like an A or a B so it will give themselves confidence and a non-lazy attitude for them to participate in any sports.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.439231004,<span style="color:white">0.529675358</span>,0.0310936132399999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If you let them play in school activities with students who have a grade C average, they may fail in school because they are putting a lot of effort in sports instead of homework.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0587597394,<span style="color:white">0.850397918</span>,0.0908423553999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They can have school spirit but at the same time they can have some time to put aside for some homework and study for a test or something else important for their grades to improve.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.195510876,<span style="color:white">0.78504613</span>,0.0194429852]</span>
