Littering is probably the worst thing out there that you can do. Something needs to change because when you just walk outside of your house there's a piece of trash and you can help by just picking that piece up. If you could get all the students doing community service then those students could inspire other students or even their brothers, sisters or even their own parents. If just one person could help pick up a little trash then imagine what ten or even fifty people could do this world would be better in no time if everybody could just pitch in a little of there time everyday by making the world a little better.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0448718843999999,0.285476654,<span style="color:white">0.6696514419999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:white">That is what i think about everybody doing some community service around here.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.621190012</span>,0.371959398,0.00685059374]</span>
