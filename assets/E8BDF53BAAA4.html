They vote and agree for whatever gives them the best intentions. Why disatisfy the people? Shouldnt they get what they want? I mean its for the people isint it? If so, then popular election it is. Think about it. The whole point of even having a president is to control and keep the United States Of America happy. Why do the oppisite? If the people are happy, and there is a comander in cheif, then its a win win situation. Every ones happy. The whole point. Why would anyone try to mess that up and change things causing chaos and unhappiness? I thought it was for the people not aginst the people. Im not wrong, and if it changes and the people are unhappy, do you really think thats going to have a positive impact on the economy and society? Unhapiness, living under terms and conditions thats in no ones favor. Sounds nice</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.804808514</span>,0.187982294,0.00720919018]</span> , that was sarcasim Senator, I dont know if youve ever heard of it. <span style="color:orange">Overall I think that popular vote is the choice to go with for electing our future President of the United States Of America.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1477472832,<span style="color:white">0.837971056</span>,0.0142816467999999]</span> </br></br>Sincerly, PROPER_NAME
