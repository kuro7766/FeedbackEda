People will think that we don't take care of our community like we should if we don't.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1405251026,<span style="color:white">0.749563292</span>,0.1099116076]</span> </br></br>Another reason why i think students should help out our community is because many people don't have homes to go to <span style="color:orange">and we need to help them out by for instant donating food for the food pantry, donating old clothes that you don't need, and more. We need to keep our community looking good and experience.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1517597152,<span style="color:white">0.7984360899999999</span>,0.0498041991999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Helping our community will make you feel good about your self and helping somebody out will make you feel like you have achieve something in life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0699295598,<span style="color:white">0.832953638</span>,0.0971168084]</span>  <span style="color:orange">From my experience helping your community will make you a better person in life and you could feel that you have done something important for your community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1634392368,<span style="color:white">0.8002723700000001</span>,0.0362883888]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Finally students should be able to help our community out cause it will help them in school by bring their grades up or by getting an award from your principal.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0849822328,<span style="color:white">0.8198335740000001</span>,0.095184196]</span>  <span style="color:white">So don't waste time playing and goofing around when somebody is in need, go a head an help them out am sure they will feel thankful that you have done something.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1417338977999999</span>,0.8139208400000001,0.0443452525999999]</span> </br></br>That is why I think students should help our community.</br></br>TEACHER_NAME,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
