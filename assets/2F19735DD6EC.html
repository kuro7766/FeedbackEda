<span style="color:white">Do you want to hear a story? so i was at work cause im a scientist an me in my friend had an agrument about what happen to mars about the facemark.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>The agrument started because we were talking talking about it an <span style="color:orange">he said that a alien put it there i said impossible.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  So he got mad at me i said state your reason why you think a alien put it there. He responed that he dont know i said you have to know something but then he saw an picture and <span style="color:orange">he said the picture look like alien heads.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Then i gave him my response he said why you don't think it's aliens i told him i don't belive and aliens. He said thats not a good enough reason because i did not state facts so i told him <span style="color:white">the reason why i dont belive aliens are real beacuse i never heard one i never saw one with my own eyes and i also said the face dont look nothing like a alien.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  The argument kept going on because he said i dont know what a alien look like so you dont.</br></br><span style="color:white">Last, we came together an said we dont know</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>  cause we kept arguing about how was a alien and how it was not a alien. He did not like my response when i said i dont know how they look how they sound thats why i said it was not a alien. It also kept going cause i did not like his response he did give me details or nothing. He just told me he look up a picture that look like alien thats why we came together and said we don't know.
