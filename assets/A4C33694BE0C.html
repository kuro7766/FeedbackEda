<span style="color:orange">Did you know in 1976 a picture was taken of a "face" on Mars?</br></br>Most people believe that it is a sign that there is life on Mars or a sign of aliens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But, people who agree with NASA know it is actually just a mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">There is two sides to this picture of a "face" either you think it is a sing of life or it is a mesa. So, the figure similar to a face isn't a face because it is similar to landforms on Earth, the figure is to big to be a real face, and it is actually a mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Matter of fact, the figure/landform on Mars similar to a "face" is a lot like landforms on planet Earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For example,"'It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin."(12) This quote provides evidence that the figure/landform on Mars is similar to landforms on Earth. So, this is evidence that the figure on Mars is just a landform like what we have on Earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Next, the figure similar to a "face" is to big to be a real face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">For example,"An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end."(1) This quote shows that the head is to big to be a real face. Like, what face is two miles long from end to end?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Last but not least, the figure/landform similar to a "face" is actually a mesa!</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For example,"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West."(12) This quote proves that the figure/landform is just a mesa. There is no life on Mars or aliens making signs. It is simply just a common landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Finally, the figure/landform similar to a face isn't a face. It isn't a face because it is a common landform on Earth. It is way to big to be a real face. Also, the figure/landform is simply just a mesa. These are all reasons and proof that the landform on Mars isn't a sign of life or aliens it is just a common landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
