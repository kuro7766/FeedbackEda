Dear Principle,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I know that you have been contemplating on whether or not it should be a requirement for the students of our school to perform community services. I think it would be in your best interest to read the letter i have taken the time to type for you.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I believe that community service should be a completely voluntary thing. But i do think that you should initiate a school wide punishment for those caught littering on campus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> </br></br>I know that my opinion might not really matter to you, and i am sure that the school board is already discussing what to do, but please hear me out. <span style="color:orange">I believe that most kids don't want to do volunteer work or community service because it doesn't appeal to their interest.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But i do believe that if you were to schedule field trips where we were able to go to a national park or something of the sort, students would be more enthusiastic about helping to clean the environment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>I hope you will take the time to read over my letter and take it into consideration. If you do not, i will understand. But i<span style="color:white">f you do use the things that i have mentioned, i would like to receive full credit for the inspiration of my ideas. Because i believe in giving credit, where credit is due.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>  I hope you come to a decision soon.</br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
