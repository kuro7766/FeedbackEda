From Rhode Island to Texas, we have power in Congress. It would simply not be fair if our small states had the same amout of power as our larger states. California has more of a population, therefore should have more say in Congress, than New Jersey. ''Your states entitles allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation; one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.'' Just the way this is set up in Congress, the same amount of power for each state is applied for choosing our President for the next four years. This is only fair to the population of America and equal representation in all the sections of congress would be unfair to the larger states that obviously require and deserve more power than the smaller states in the United States.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.22383789064,<span style="color:white">0.3149229867999999</span>,0.461239155]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Basically, power is fairly given to each state under the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.05911899572,<span style="color:white">0.51290575</span>,0.427975276]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">''The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.'' Though this situation is rare, in 1968 when Nixon ran against Clinton, both had a total of 43 percent of the popular votes. Yet, because of the Electoral College, a clear winner was shown. If ever in case of this event, this ''pressure'' can complicate and make the choosing of the President way more difficult than it was planned to be. For this reason, our Electoral College sets up a way to take care of this if it was to happen again.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0429091983999999,<span style="color:white">0.338722008</span>,0.618368772]</span>  Obviously, <span style="color:orange">the Electoral College shows a clear winner and takes out any confusion or problems that could arise.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0263146864599999,<span style="color:white">0.435046462</span>,0.5386388520000001]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">To conclude, our country is based off of fair rules and systems, one of them being the Electoral College. It is fair because it does not have full power, the right amount of power is applied to each state, and it produces a clear winner.
