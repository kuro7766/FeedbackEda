<span style="color:orange">Electoral College? Are you serious? Why is the election set up like this? I though it was a free country. But no. You guys practically vote on your own. You just make it look like you guys care, taking advice from the people in the states, but it's really just your decision. I want to choose freely, not think I am choosing freely. The President is a person who takes action in the country and we the people, want to choose the right one. You guys even show it sometimes. In the state, we might have a majority pick for one president, but you end up picking another one instead.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.14940656,<span style="color:white">0.6288711379999999</span>,0.22172229]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I understand that the Electoral College represents us by the number of people in the state, but there's one problem, you're not representing us well.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.474028906,<span style="color:white">0.514633136</span>,0.0113379496999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think that the United States shouldn't have the Electoral College and should just have a president win by the most votes. This is truly the best way to choose a president. I seriously don't like the idea about Electoral College and I think that the U.S should change that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0422122156,<span style="color:white">0.733377878</span>,0.2244098859999999]</span> </br></br>Look, Whomever this reaches, I just want you to know, <span style="color:white">many people out there, in the U.S, feel the same way as I about the Electoral College.
