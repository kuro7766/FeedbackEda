Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I understand that you want us to do community service, but some people just don't have time to do things like that</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Like, say that you say we have to do it on a Saturday at 9:00am to 12:00pm not everybody can make that time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also not everybody want to do it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">I think that you should do it at a different school because you are trying to force us to do community service and we don't want to do it. Why don't you get out of that desk and you do it too.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Sorry, not to be mean, but I really want to do it, but I don't have time for it. I'm in the 8th grade and i get a lot of homework to do. And I have to keep up with my grades. And I have to focus on the CMT test that is coming up</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I think that it should be optional weather we do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
