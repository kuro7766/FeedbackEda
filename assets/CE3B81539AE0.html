One of the reasons that our country is still standing today is because we as a nation have pick a great president, without hessition. Back in the old days we didnt have a right to vote. We are blessed to be able to vote and a system like the electrol college today. If we lose the electrol college we lose hope and faith that our country we be still standing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.8143360959999999</span>,0.1835800248,0.00208387662]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">In conclusion,</br></br>We americans are sometimes not greatful for the things we have but without we are lost.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.7357363800000001</span>,0.262957982,0.00130562342]</span>  Senator we need your help.
