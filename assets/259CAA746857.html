dear state senator, <span style="color:orange">in my opinion, i would want to keep the electoral college,</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.1179658707999999,<span style="color:white">0.87394796</span>,0.00808614732]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because the electoral college been around since our founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.273034944,<span style="color:white">0.7230188740000001</span>,0.00394618162]</span>  <span style="color:white">it consist of a presidency election on which who wants to be in office. for instance each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. which electors are choosen by the political party.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.6894349200000001</span>,0.308685578,0.00187947732]</span>  <span style="color:white">you ahhve a right to vote. you can help choose your state's electors when you vote. because when you vote your actually voting for your canidate's electors to help them out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.6027081519999999</span>,0.39485017,0.00244165426]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">in your state it shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year. but then if you think of its actually wrong because its of how many votes can the electors can get not the president. after the presidential election, your state governor prepares a 'certificate of ascerainment'.</br></br>over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we would want to have. this year voters can exspect another close election in which popular vote winner could again lose the presidency, but yet the electoral college has it defenders.</br></br>for example like obama had 61.7% of voters against romney who had 51.3% of votes but people say it was a tie which most likely i disagree on that. becuase its a like a win or lose game who ever wins gets the treatment, but really the president doesnt really dont do nothing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.92206322</span>,0.0763950672,0.001541671696]</span>
