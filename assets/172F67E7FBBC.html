Dear, principal <span style="color:orange">i think that you should not make students do community service to students that don't like doing it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">First i want you to know that is a good thing that you thing of that but if students don't want to help and you sent them do something i think they are going to make it worst.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">EX: you sent them to go pick up trash and they go and they are just playing around they are going to be fighting with the trash throwing it where it was clean then later when they finish playing they are going to see a mess that they are going to get lazy and just walk away and go to another place where its cleaner and if they are trouble makers they are going to do that over and over again.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Think about it <span style="color:orange">if you let students that really want to help out and they do the same thing (throw the trash to each other) and if they really want to help out they are going to clean for them selves. and they are going to be helping because they want to ,not because you forced them to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I was also thinking of you giving 2 choices 1*students should do community service 2*students get to do extra home work for their hardest classes(where they are almost flunking the class)................</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  come on unlist think about it.</br></br>from one of your best students</br></br>*STUDENT_NAME
