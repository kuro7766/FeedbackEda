The text says that "Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." Venus is so similar to Earth, but yet so challenging to explore.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Second, just like Earth Venus has mountains and valleys.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some might even say long ago there were oceans, because the text says "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Then, Venus is known to be Earth's sister planet!</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Venus has always been the closest planet to Earth other than Mars, but if Venus is so much like Earth astronomers can't figure out why it's so much more inhospitable than Earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, Venus is a very challenging place to see and be. Venus has not been touched in more than 30 years! In the text it says ".. not a singlr spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades." So although Venus is the sister of Earth astronomers know very little about her. So they keep in pursuit to learn more despite the dangers it presents everytime.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
