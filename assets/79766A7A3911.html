<span style="color:orange">In the first photo it looks like it is a human face but when it goes to the second photo it look sbasically like nothing. Maybe just like a cloud but nothing really then when it goes to the last photo it looks like it is a hard object but it has cracks in it. In the story it says " Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars." it says that something funny happened. It did not happen on purpose so we do not know if it was an alien or another creature.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0980882666,<span style="color:white">0.8563358019999999</span>,0.0455759102]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">They thought that it was a Martin mesa but it was common for that to happen around Cydonia.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.068022584,<span style="color:white">0.90432828</span>,0.027649115]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The "Face" had an unusal shadow on it like it was made to look like an Egyptian Pharoh. It only loooked like that in the first photo not the second or third. When NASA took photos of the face and put them on the internet everyone basically freaked out because they thought it was a sign for alien life. It could be but there can be many other reasons why it looks like a face. They say that it could be just a natural landform but many people like to think that "oh it is not it is a sign of alien life".</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0858586976,<span style="color:white">0.8732626939999999</span>,0.0408786046]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The caption on the photo when they posted it on the internet was "Huge rock formation...Which resembles a human head... formed by sadow giving illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1031606588,<span style="color:white">0.8719279120000001</span>,0.02491144]</span> . <span style="color:orange">That was a go getter for attention it looks like they just want to get attention so they can scare people like a lot of people do. It was a good way to engage the public but it was also a bad way of getting their attention. It was bad because a lot of people can get scared because of something they hear and this story did not seem really believeable. A lot of people will believe anything they see on the internet it bacisally does not matter on what it is about they will just believe it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.245927618,<span style="color:white">0.735880992</span>,0.0181914244]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">"The Face on Mars" had became a pop icon it was on Hollywood films, in books, magazines, and radio talk shows</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.200836053,<span style="color:white">0.785944664</span>,0.01321929768]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Also in the story it says "It once haunted a grocery store check out line for 25 years.". That is just crazy that peope will believe things like that ! Sometimes people just want to scare other people and tell them lies about anything.

They went back on a cloudless summer day to see if they can get a better photo then before to see what it was.</br></br>It showed that it was a Martain equivelent of a butte or mesa.
