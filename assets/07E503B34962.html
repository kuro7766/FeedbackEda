Dear,</br></br>TEACHER_NAME</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think all of the kids in our community should do community service whether its with younger children or even just picking trash up along the road side.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  I would greatly appreciate for you to support my ideas that i am about to share with you.</br></br><span style="color:orange">The main reason i believe that we should support the idea of community service is because it shows responsibility and respect for the community we live in.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Helping other people that could not help themselves would show great citizenship.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There is not just helping people for community service. You could pick up trash and let people know we are serious about being a clean town</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Sometimes community service is the best for kids with problems</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because they don't have a roll model in their life at least a good roll model that can set good goals and responsibilities for them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">These are some of my ideas and opinions about community service being good for us.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>  I hope your found an interest in my thoughts and ideas on community service. I would like for you to take this into consideration maybe talk to the school board and have a community service club put up for waterloo local school kids to do and have fun.</br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
