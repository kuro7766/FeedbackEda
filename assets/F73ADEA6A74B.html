To the principal:</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I think it is a brilliant idea for us the students, to take on a opportunity to help out by doing community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.014144296,0.430955898,<span style="color:white">0.554899806</span>]</span> <span style="color:orange">.

For an example It's like taking care of your room, what if one day you decided not to put things in there proper places and just threw things anywhere and left it untidy? It might begin to smell, or you might even discover things missing. So taking care of our community is like taking care of own self. Doing this could be a really good deed, giving back to the community to make it a healthier place. For example, maybe we can go 2-3 times a week picking up trash, even just starting with our own football field.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01959732916,0.2129008428,<span style="color:white">0.76750184</span>]</span>  In closing i would like to say, <span style="color:orange">you should really think about this and decide to take part in it because it would make our community better and cleaner and it</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1470312147999999,<span style="color:white">0.7617131819999999</span>,0.09125557]</span>
