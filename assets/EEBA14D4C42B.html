This means that the landform was made by natural occurances. The landform is natural. The passage also says "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reavealing... a natural landform. This means that there was no alien monument after all." There is much more proof of this landform being natural than there is being made by aliens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0851551505999999,<span style="color:white">0.8350135399999999</span>,0.0798313215999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Others say, that aliens made this formation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.25385341,<span style="color:white">0.734922442</span>,0.01122417634]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The article states that "Conspiracy theorists say that the Face is evidence that NASA would rather hide."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.26425178,<span style="color:white">0.7251034999999999</span>,0.0106447259]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The thing that they do not realize is the fact that they have no proof of NASA "making up" a story like this.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.28849327,<span style="color:white">0.69792764</span>,0.01357909768]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Theorists have not studied the landform as much as we have.
