Also in paragraph 3, is saids "the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." These issues are way too dangerous for humans to be on. Solar power could be plentiful but the raditation would not exceed Earth levels. This may still be survival for humans.</br></br>In paragraph 6, it states "researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."
