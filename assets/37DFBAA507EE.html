"The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast." What this means is that basically the election is based on what they decide not on what the people say</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0604076806,<span style="color:white">0.7265655899999999</span>,0.213026742]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">Furthermore, the only thing the people do by voting is that they influence the electoral college's decision.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0457611742879999,<span style="color:white">0.633323922</span>,0.3209149]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The people dont really get to choose who they believe should be in office. All the electoral college does is get in the way of whom the people choose to be president. The electoral college should be removed and replaced with popular vote.

So really the peoples vote doesnt even matter. All it does is influence the vote of some representative from the electoral college. I believe that this should be changed to popular vote. In which the people vote for the candidate they want to be president and then all the votes are counted up and compared. Thats the way the presidential should be done.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.12847892866,<span style="color:white">0.589115506</span>,0.2824055951999999]</span>  <span style="color:white">This is the best way for the peoples voice to be recognized and it will make a difference.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.11902776168</span>,0.72213092,0.1588413146]</span>
