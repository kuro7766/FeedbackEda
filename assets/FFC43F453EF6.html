Senador first I want to say that <span style="color:orange">I dissagree with the idea of the Electoral college</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  becouse <span style="color:orange">the people needs vote for the president that they want"that's democrastic".</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  One of the reasons is that <span style="color:orange">the Electoral College is unfair</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> ,<span style="color:orange">outdated</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">irrational.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachorsims,not democratic method of selecting a president that ought to oberruled by declaring the candidate who recieve the most popular votes the winners. Its entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the nation popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">There's a few reasons for retainig the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: the first one is that a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective]</span>  ,but it's possible,<span style="color:orange">but it's likely that a disputate over the popular vote</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> . Other is that <span style="color:orange">the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in wich no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  For all that reasons and more <span style="color:white">I think that you need put off the Electoral College,and let the people pick for the presidents that they want.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
