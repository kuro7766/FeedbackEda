Which equals into a deadlocked election</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Lastly, this process is outdated and irrational. arguments against direct elections are spurious and should completely vanish this process.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>
