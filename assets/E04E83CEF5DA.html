In paragraph four it's telling us that when the software is tracking the persons emotion it shows them how many emotions they feel even if there mixed which agin doesn't make no sence for me because you can totally know or tell just by the person face expressing they do. In the very top off the article of mona lisa's picture you can totally see thats shes happy,ferful. And i only looked at the picture for some secounds which makes no sence of why i'll need a device to tell me how she feels. In paragraph six it's showing us that if your in a classroom confuse a teacher can stop the lesson and tell you which part you don't get . Which is good at some point it's not because what if the teacher stop because of one student and then seconds later or minutes later the person changes to a complety different mood .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.490706096,<span style="color:white">0.505670684</span>,0.0036232369799999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">At the end i think that there's no need for you to know if the person if feeling bad or happy .What if the person is feeling not so good because of family issues? As a person , we wanna just move on and not remind are self of what just happen because it'll make us more disapointed then we already are. I think that less technoloy makes people less crazy and less stressful. The new technoloy is going way to far for this to just makes this up and just imagin something even worst that they made up off.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.328576422,<span style="color:white">0.6670619259999999</span>,0.0043616665]</span>
