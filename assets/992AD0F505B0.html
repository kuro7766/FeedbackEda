Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I would like to argue that we should change to doing the election by popular votes not by the Electoral College. It is unfair to but the pressure of picking the right candidate on the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">We should just let it be by popular votes because it wold not be that hard to find out which states had the most popular candidate</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">It would be harder to let the Electoral College pick the candidates.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">For starters some people might want to know what to Electoral College is and they might want to send you a letter about it and what would you say? Something along the lines like they are the ones who pick the votes for the candidates?</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">This is what I got out of</br></br>Source 1: What Is the Electoral College?</br></br>" The Electoral College is a process, not a place." Some people might not understand that. It also states that it consists of selections of all the electors, it is also a meeting place for the electors to vote for the President and the Vice President, and it also used for counting of the electoral votes made by the Congress. At the Electoral College also consists of 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President. Every candidate that is running for President in your state has their own group of electors. They are usally generally chosen the candidaate's party.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In</br></br>Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best- laid defenses of the system are wrong.</br></br>They want to abolish the College becaus eit is unfair to the people that want to vote for their own candidate's and not have some college do it for them.
