For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent of plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electotal College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively).There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner...."</br></br>The importance in the counterclaim is that it shows that the Electoral College process had a clear winner.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0790061428,0.490657786,<span style="color:white">0.430336066</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also, the Electoral College should stay our way of voting because of majority vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.189946652,<span style="color:white">0.716750416</span>,0.0933029172]</span>  <span style="color:white">The Office of the Federal Register states in their article "</br></br>What is the Electoral College?"</br></br>in the third paragraph.
