Dear senator, <span style="color:yellow">the Electoral College has always been a good way to elect our leaders, and it is the best way to do it</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0240604102,0.5907888299999999,<span style="color:white">0.3851507719999999</span>]</span> . <span style="color:orange">It has the ability to use swing states for better voting</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0321646852,<span style="color:white">0.642443444</span>,0.325391844]</span> , <span style="color:orange">larger and smaller states get diffrent amounts of electoral votes,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1124235574,<span style="color:white">0.68984337</span>,0.197733082]</span>  <span style="color:orange">and presidents cannot be elected by a region alone.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0449816804,<span style="color:white">0.6748944320000001</span>,0.2801238908]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The effect of having swing states because of the Electoral College is a positive one</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0446314646,<span style="color:white">0.7468771820000001</span>,0.208491375]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">because when a state feels like they have a chance of having their candidate win, they put more thought into the vote they cast knowing that their vote counts. Having voters put more thought into their votes instead of not caring as much gives the better candidate a greater chance of winning, if one candidate was truly better than the other. The more thoughtfull canidates in a swing state will pull more information from the candidates campaigns. Popular vote does not use the winner takes all method so the idea of swing states will no longer have any effect in the election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0664287108,0.620474064,<span style="color:white">0.313097235</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Another great reason why the Electoral College is better than popular vote is because depending on the size of the states a certain amount of votes is given to the electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0731705216,<span style="color:white">0.633180842</span>,0.2936486092]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Larger states get more attention from presidential candidates because of the majority vote in the particular state.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.197683697,<span style="color:white">0.756149654</span>,0.0461666311999999]</span>  <span style="color:white">if there was only popular vote then presidential candidates could waste their time on smaller states when they could of been winning larger states.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.145257413</span>,0.796548008,0.0581945629999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The varying amount of electoral votes for each state depending on its size also allows for a more equal and fair election, due to the less populated states not being able to have more electoral votes then the more populated states.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0981055306,<span style="color:white">0.78233021</span>,0.1195642774]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electoral College allows that presidential canidates cannot win the election by reigional appeal.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0505434081999999,<span style="color:white">0.6492146560000001</span>,0.300241956]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This means that if a particular reigion favors a candidate they cannot win by only a single regions votes. This makes the candidates campaign less in regions that are more likely to be won and more in other regions. But with the Electoral College this makes it harder for a candidate with only regional appeal to win because other regions feel like their votes will not be as effective towards the election. With popular vote a presidential candidate will not know where to campaign and where not because there is no winner take all method.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0816087492,<span style="color:white">0.645917486</span>,0.272473774]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This is why I belive that having the Electoral College is superior to popular vote when we the people vote for presidential candidates.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1191909249999999,<span style="color:white">0.82377506</span>,0.057034014]</span>        Â
