When it comes time for a job and you have to be at work at 8:30 then you need to be ready so you can make it in on time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2264832779999999,<span style="color:white">0.764003514</span>,0.0095131950599999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If a student was to do the distance learning they will be cut short from after school actives.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0620394904,<span style="color:white">0.914522728</span>,0.0234377676]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For example, if you wish to play a sport you have to be at your home school for at least three classes.
