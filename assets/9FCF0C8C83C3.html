<span style="color:orange">After reading the passage I came to the conclusion that some ways I think it's not valueble</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  . <span style="color:orange">FACS would be a smart tool for case workers or counslers</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  . <span style="color:orange">Some case workers deal with people who have emotion diseases such as post dramaic stress diseases in that nature . I feel like the creator could've made the tool for more serious reason, not that the emotion FACS was pointless but who would want to just find out their emotion and they can already feel it or going through it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I feel like people would want to find out things more important like , whats going with that person , is the person feeling sick , is the person healthy . FACS could been about how's the day going to go , whats the weather going to be like</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  . <span style="color:orange">I feel like FACS is all hype in some way because it's basic</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  , like yay we can see how we feel right?</br></br><span style="color:orange">They took all this time and objects figure how someones doing or feelings , instead of how we're living . Anyone can figure out someone's emotion expresses by their body language , their tone , how their speaking , when their speaking and etc. Often people may not want to speak on how they feel , alot of times teens want to keep their problems and emotions to them selves</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Students are diffrent from adults, and also handle emotions diffrently.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">FACS would be valueble if they come with conclusions to that person emotion at the time , plenty of ways technology can do things. If the FACS were a solution to a person with a bad day it would be valueble. Due to the fact their making this like it's a cool invention when FACS is exposing peoples feelings and then wat after that? I feel like the FACS should be upgraded and do more with it .</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
