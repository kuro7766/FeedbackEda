Dear my state senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I would like to keep the Electoral College. I think it would be better for the people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Voters in presidential elction are people who want to express a politcal preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.</br></br>The Electoral Collge, ancachronism, a non-demoocratic  method of selecting a president that should be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The Electoral College method is not democatic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candiate your actully vting for a slate of electors. Our fouding fathers established it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Certanity of Outcome</br></br>Everyone's President swing States</br></br>Big Stats</br></br>Avoid Run-Off Elections</br></br><span style="color:white">A magority of 270 elctors votes are reqiured. 3 Electors and treated like a state of purpose.
