Dear principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I heard you are reconsidering the school cell phone policy. I also heard you were thinking of two different polices. one is where you would let students use there cell phones during lunch periods and other free times as long as they were off during class time. The other policy is that students are not allowed to have phones at school at all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">personally</br></br>I think you should go with policy one. The reason for that is if students don't have there cell phone they want be able to call there parents in case of an emergency.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Like if they miss there bus, or if they get sick.</br></br>There is no harm if kids use there cell phone during lunch, or there free time at school.</br></br>As long as they keep them off during class. No one is being distract. No is being interrupted.</br></br>Finally no one is cheating.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>
