For example, Google's semi-autonomous creations are "not truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways and when other complicated traffic issues arise."</br></br>Sensors are what enable these vehicles to perform the tasks that astonish many to this day. Due to the fact that sensors have been used since the 1980s, vast improvements and tests have been conducted over the years to ensure that the safety of the consumer and those around he/she are preserved. The article even states that "Within 10 years, those sensors [from the 1980s] had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers." These vehicles allow for the potential decrease in drunk driving, which further emphasizes that safety is not only preserved with semi-autonomous cars, but is heavily increased.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000723865044,0.0315888255999999,<span style="color:white">0.967687312</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There is a common misconception that by implementing the production of these vehicles, drivers will "get bored of waiting for their turn to drive."</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0055152454199999,<span style="color:white">0.249544276</span>,0.7449404580000001]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Although this is an issue that many psychologists are considering, some manufacturers are working to eliminate this issue.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.0177837654,<span style="color:white">0.362787236</span>,0.6194290219999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For example, the article suggests that there are a few car manufacturers that are hoping to rid of this anxiety by bringing in-car diplays and information systems that use heads-up displays.
