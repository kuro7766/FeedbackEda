The Electoral College is a process that makes voting easier for the government. They have to select electors, then they all have a meeting to vote for the President and Vice President, and then the counting of the eletoral votes by congress. It consists of 538 electors. But a major of 270 electroal votes in order to elect the President. Another example John F. Kennedy had a popular that vote would have went to him.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.608009278</span>,0.380165698,0.0118249913]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electoral college is unfair to voters,because of the winner-take-all system in each state,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0748506798,<span style="color:white">0.884577932</span>,0.0405714177999999]</span>  <span style="color:white">the candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, which focuses only on the tight races in the "swing" states.
