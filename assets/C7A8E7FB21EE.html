Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I most likely disagree that the students and I must maintain a B or higher average to participate in gym and other activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.095969576,<span style="color:white">0.841253382</span>,0.0627770172]</span> </br></br>My reasoning is that, <span style="color:orange">not all students are as smart as others. The students that have a C average or lower, should have a study period or a tutoring session.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0390602430999999,<span style="color:white">0.732914988</span>,0.228024758]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think this because, some kids need a little extra help or push to help them understand the material that they are learning in class. Especially, if the students have the tutoring session, maybe the kids will comprehend and understand more. Which, if the students comprehend more, then they will have the privilege to participate in gym or in other activities.</br></br>Also, if the student maintains a C or lower average, and they're in a tutoring session, I don't think it's fair that they're not allowed to participate in gym or other activities. In this case, I think the school should open up an after school program for gym or activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.142521408,<span style="color:white">0.59148859</span>,0.2659900266]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, <span style="color:white">I do not think it is fair that students have to maintain a B or higher average to participate in gym or in other activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.2975172339999999</span>,0.6838602460000001,0.01862252834]</span>
