<span style="color:yellow">There has been a strong arguement going on weather we should keep the Electoral College or if we should change it. Both sides have made a strong claim and a strong arguement. I got the opportunity to read two articles that are against and in favor of it. After reading these articles I have made decision.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I have came to the conclusion that we should keep the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">My first reason why, we should keep Electoral College is because this country was founded on it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also, our 4 founding fathers were in favor of this Electoral College. This is a principle in which this great country has been founded on. This is the history of this country and the principles on which it was founded on.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Another reason why, we should keep Electoral College is that this would avoid the run off of elections</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">If there was no Electoral College candidates will be fighting for the popular vote. The problem with this popular vote is that there would be no candidate that recieves a majority of the votes. In an Electoral College there would not be this problem, since in each state the winner takes it all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Last but not least, we should keep Electoral College because this allows for each candidate to pick his or her own groups of electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This allows the running candidate to pick out the group that he or she would be able to work with the best, and get along with the most. This would also allow the candidate to better fight or argue on certain matters and on certain cases. Also, it is important for a candidate to get along with his or her group that they will be working with.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">These are all of the reasons why I think and belive that we should keep Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
