Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">Helping the community is very important, and I'm sure many people think that. There are many citizens that volunteer for community services such as picking up litter, tutoring children, helping in soup kitchens, etc.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.00681248422,0.190433482,<span style="color:white">0.8027540200000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">As important as community service is, I do not believe it should be mandatory</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.01351390082,0.33215578,<span style="color:white">0.654330324</span>]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:yellow">Many students have other extra curricular activities, and jobs in or out of the house they must participate in.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0076199059,0.2144431619999999,<span style="color:white">0.7779369199999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Therefore, I'm sure these students don't have the time after school to do community service. If those kids had to do community service, it would most likely add stress to their lives and give them less time to do homework, so their grades could begin to slip. On the weekends is when kids relax and have fun with their friends and family, so it wouldn't be a good idea to make community service time on the weekend.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00561141674,0.111533412,<span style="color:white">0.8828552000000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">But, if you really think it's a good idea that kids help their community, maybe in some classrooms, teachers could put a donation box</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0182786413,<span style="color:white">0.291163058</span>,0.690558318]</span>  <span style="color:orange">where kids could donate money to a local organization. The class with the most donations can win a pizza party, or a trip somewhere - maybe a trip to the organizations headquarters to see how everything works?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0740764404,<span style="color:white">0.470308636</span>,0.455614902]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
