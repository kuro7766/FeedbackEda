dear principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I truly believe that not all students should be apart of community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . And these are my reasons to back it up. <span style="color:orange">My first reason is that some kids do want to help their community and make it a better place, but some kids have a lot to of stuff to do and can't really fit that in</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">My second reason is that most kids are just plain lazy</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Don't want to do anything with there lives or do something for their community. So it really would be a waste of time trying to make students go and do community service because all they is going to do is just sit there and complain or just don't come</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . So from my point of view as a student</br></br><span style="color:white">I think that you should have kids decide on going to do community service. and decide what time is good for them to go and do it!</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Thank you.
