Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:white">I understand that you wish to change our school policy regarding requirements for sports.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.282871662</span>,0.670777108,0.0463512476]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Now I know that we have many wonderful students who are tremendous at their sport and they made a commitment to have a C average or above</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.183514899,<span style="color:white">0.770520062</span>,0.0459650406]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Raising the requirements to a B average would make them try harder, but some would give up because they think its too hard</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.037787188,<span style="color:white">0.67349168</span>,0.288721124]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Having smart students who participate in sports would be quite interesting but what about our star Football players, Basketball players, or Cheerleaders who have a C average and have to give up something they love. Now I know I wouldn't want to give up my sport because of my grades, and i know you love watching our teams win. And if every athlete who have a C average quit their sport then we would have very few athletes in our school and a less likely chance of winning our games and that wouldn't be first-rate now would it?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.145141613,<span style="color:white">0.645208446</span>,0.209649918]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Our students have fair grades but I do admit they could be better, I believe we should recommend B averages instead of enforcing a "law" about them</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1322669932,<span style="color:white">0.6631137739999999</span>,0.204619242]</span> . Other than sports there are the OTHER_NAME, Beta Club, and Art Club. If we raised the requirements for the grade average then some students wouldn't be able to participate in these clubs, and it would be a pity if we had to lose very important members of our clubs. Why raise the Grade average when it is fine the way it is? <span style="color:orange">I think that we should leave it the way it is now and keep our sports teams, academic teams, and school clubs the way they're supposed to be with every member remaining on that specific group, club, team, or whatever you wish to call it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.1001850436,<span style="color:white">0.654001618</span>,0.2458133199999999]</span>
