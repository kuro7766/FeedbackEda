Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Do you have a cell phone? It is nice to have, isn't it? You can do so many things with your cell phone like getting on the internet, getting in touch with friends, or keeping track of stuff. Well all these things could help during school</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0686125077999999,<span style="color:white">0.8688722819999999</span>,0.062515221]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I'm not saying you should let us have it out during class, but in between class periods or during lunch. It would be a big help to us and you. By that I mean our education.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0320937364,<span style="color:white">0.851917212</span>,0.115989033]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If you allowed us to take our phones out in between classes, we cold swiftly study for a quiz or exam we had in an upcoming period.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0357888288,<span style="color:white">0.850353166</span>,0.1138580106]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This would help you in our school test score rating overall.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.358622378,<span style="color:white">0.635277752</span>,0.00609989328]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">When we are in school for so long, we students tend to get bored and so we start talking then the teacher gets mad because we are to loud or we are talking while he/she is talking.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1332273209999999,<span style="color:white">0.84416142</span>,0.022611261]</span>  <span style="color:orange">A way to prevent that is to let us have our phones out during lunch so we can talk to our friends.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0488984796,<span style="color:white">0.895054144</span>,0.0560473898]</span>  <span style="color:orange">You might say we get to talk to our friends all the time.
