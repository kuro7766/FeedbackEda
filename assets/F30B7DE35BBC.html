Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Due to the following situation on being able to use phones in free time such as lunch or to not allow students to use phones at all. As a result I am writing to you telling you what I think they should do for this policy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I support the following situation on allowing students to use their phones during lunch and other free time, but has to be turned off during classes</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because students may need to contact a parent or guardian,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">some students just feel more comfortable having their phones with them,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">also some parents might want them to have the phones with them in case of an emergency.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  Think about it and think what would you want your school to have if you were in my position.</br></br><span style="color:orange">To start with, because students may need to contact a parent or guardian and the school wont let them use there phone, because they don't think it is important.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Also some people need to call their legal guardian and ask them if they can stay after school, to study, do a project, or watch a sports game after school. Since the school won't let them call home and ask they either don't go or go and don't call home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In addition, some students just feel more comfortable having their phone on with them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Most people feel safer because it is always on and if they needed call anyone in case of an emergency. I know my mom would like me to have my phone on with me in case anything bad happened and I needed to call someone for help.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, most parents would feel more comfortable knowing that their kids phone is on and charged,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">so if they ever needed them they would call them and they would answer right away.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Don't forget to think about my ideas and I hope they put a big difference on you allowing phones to be used during free time like lunch and off during classes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>I hope you thought about what you would want the principal to do if you were in my position. Remember I support the following situation on allowing students to use their cell phones in free time during the school day and off during the class period <span style="color:orange">because students may need to contact a parent or guardian,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  some students feel safer with their phones on, and some parents would like to know that their kids phones are on in case of an emergency.</br></br>Thank you for considering asking the students what they think.</br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>A Concerned Student
