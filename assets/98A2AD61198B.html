If one kid needs more practice, they are able to practice while another kid may be ready to move onto the next. This way the one that is moving on isn't being held back by the kid who might want a little more time on a unit or topic. Students create their own education plan which is also good for the teacher because sometimes it may not be easy, in a classroom setting, to spot when a kid needs a little more attention and work on a topic because they have to move as a group to finish all the units before a final or AP exam. Personalized education through online classes would allow for kids to finish everything before these exams but still learn the way they see best fit.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000621316146,0.0445463201999999,<span style="color:white">0.954832366</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Because students are able to work at their own pace, they also are given more free time than in school education accounts for.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00202192746,0.164265916,<span style="color:white">0.8337121599999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">This free time is also beneficial to students as it is an opportunity for them to explore career choices and other things that interest them. Free time gives these students a chance to be involved in the community more through different things such as volunteering, having a job, working for an internship, and so much more. For example, one online student I know likes to volunteer at the animal shelter when she can because she wants to become a veterinarian. Her free time allows for her to learn more information and develop the skills for what she wants in the future. It sets kids up for success rather than failure by allowing them to find interests in high schoolÂ rather than switching subjects every year in college. This free time lets them create a more lasting impact on their community while also finding out more about the real world and what it hold for students when they graduate.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000687119412,0.0354231584,<span style="color:white">0.963889802</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Finally, one of the most important parts of online learning, students are able to build better mental health with the change in environment</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0029162014399999,<span style="color:white">0.203466446</span>,0.793617332]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Mental health is one of the biggest issues for teenagers in today's society. Many students feel trapped in school where they have nowhere to go and malice is inevitable. Students feel stressed, anxious, and depressed from traditional school which leads to their mental health deteriorating. But through online school, students will have a more open environment where they choose who is in and out of their life, so they are no longer forced to be around the people that hurt their mental health. It will decrease in mental health issues but it also allows for more time to be spent with the people they love and care about, which in turn builds their mental health up. Schools force kids to be with one another even if the none of them want to be there. Online school solves this by letting kids have more freedom with the social aspect of their life and do what they feel is best for their mental health.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0007201351719999,0.037768057,<span style="color:white">0.961511828</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, students will greatly benefit from online school because it will let them make more out of their life than sitting in a building for 7 hours a day. Students can create an education plan that fits them better, explore what they world has to offer, and build better mental health while they do online school. Now the question is, will society progress for all students to attend online school or will they be stuck in their ways of conventional schooling?</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.00204070632,<span style="color:white">0.1355185672</span>,0.862440718]</span>
