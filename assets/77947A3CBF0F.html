Dear, TEACHER_NAME</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are off or on silent during class time is a great idea</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0386565146,<span style="color:white">0.951298802</span>,0.0100446652599999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because use kids be in school for a long time and sometimes we do get bored and off task</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1006421082,<span style="color:white">0.895549348</span>,0.00380854282]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but if we had our cell phone to living it up it would be much better as long as we can still come to class and get our work done.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.208891094,<span style="color:white">0.7884538560000001</span>,0.00265503942]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">But i also may think that its a bad idea because if more kids are being allowed to bring their cell phones to school that might cause more bullying and problems like phones getting lost, stole, broken and possibly taking when in class because students mite for get to turn it on silent or off before classes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.1160311425999999,<span style="color:white">0.8744827279999999</span>,0.00948614844]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It also may be a very good idea because some penents don't allow their kids to take their cell phone to school because it is not allowed with in the building but if the children are allowed to use the phone with in some periods of the day.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1497168159999999,<span style="color:white">0.8441076519999999</span>,0.0061755518]</span>  <span style="color:white">The perents will allow the kids to bring the phone to the school. So that the kids that walk to school can feel safe and protected. so that if something goes wrong like someone trying to take the child they can feel safe cause they will have their phone and the perents wont have to worry about if their child got to school safe or not.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.2860338012</span>,0.7103352279999999,0.003630975]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">S yes i think that it is a good and bad idea for the kids to bring their phone to school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.470999722</span>,0.5278508,0.0011494915419999]</span>
