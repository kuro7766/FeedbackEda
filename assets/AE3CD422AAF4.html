You can keep supervision on the voting stands and make sure nobody puts in more than one vote for one person and also monitor the people who sort the votes. People are very selfish and only think of themselves and thats why you shouldn't have other people go and vote for the party's canidate. The Electoral College system was made when thinking out of the box wasn't a good thing. The Electoral College system is unfair for voters and outdated.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.199018218</span>,0.6567393,0.144242462]</span>
