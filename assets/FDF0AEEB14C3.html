<span style="color:yellow">Going to school everyday can be difficult for certain students. Many kids and adults have work, sports, or medical problems that can get in the way of their learning life. This can affect the students education gravely and it can even prevent them from moving forward in their education. Although, people prefer their children to go to school where there are teachers and people who can help them, actually, it is better to have the option to learn through an online class</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.00156837356,0.101583706,<span style="color:white">0.8968479540000001</span>]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Online classes can help students who are not able to maintain the everyday school life</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.00886372448,<span style="color:white">0.374893636</span>,0.616242632]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">because they may have certain things that can get in the way that an online class can work around like, balancing work and school, or having appointments and events at the same time school is taking place.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0013149407799999,0.123602981,<span style="color:white">0.8750820560000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Every student is different and every student has a different life they have to maintain. For example, one kid may have to help support their family and is unable to attend school everyday. Even if they wanted to go the school and get an education, they have other things getting in the way. This can hold them back and hurt the education that they need to get to be able to have that steady life and career. If they were able to take an online class, that can work around their schedule, they could help their family out and also maintain an education. This shows that in certain cases online classes are needed and they should be accessible to any student that needs them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0009285063039999,0.0645863224,<span style="color:white">0.934485186</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Many parents and adults will argue that students will not get as much work done at home because there are too many distractions and there is not a teacher that can help them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.00324587334,0.191456918,<span style="color:white">0.805297236</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">This is a good point because if you are schooled online then you are more likely to get distracted from your work and do something else instead like play with your friends.

Though there may be some areas in online classes that bring up questions like whether students will be able to get all their work done from home, there are many ways around these problems that schools should be able to figure out, to make their students educations as good as in classrooms. There are too many benefits to online classes to not consider them. Online classes will change the dynamics of education but they will change them for the better. Students should have a right to to decide whether to go to school and focus on their education in a facility that promotes learning, students should also have the option to choose whether to take online classes and focus on other aspects of their life like their career or interests.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.000572118176,0.053708715,<span style="color:white">0.94571918</span>]</span>
