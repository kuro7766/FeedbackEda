You might end up at the wrong place. Lawmakers themself even agree that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Also, if we went driverless, it would give drunks an "ok" to drive because technically, they aren't driving.. which would cause a whole nother problem.</br></br>If we went driverless, it would look cool for awhile, but eventually everything would crash. The cars might not be programmed correctly, people would put the blame on the car and not themself, it would cost us a tremendous amount of more money.
