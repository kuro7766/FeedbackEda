Dear State Senator,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">The one word used throughout this whole article ; catastrophic, which is whats best used to describe the electoral college. The United States of America, born and based off of popular soverignty, should be just  that ; decided by the people. The electoral college has only been a hindrance since its arrival, confusing American Citizens left and right, becoming an issue to voters/interested future voters, and disallowing a fair chance of a voters vote to be of importance in their state, and to their country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0022603180999999,0.0948255922,<span style="color:white">0.902914096</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The electoral college should be disbanded and reiterized by popular vote</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.01042463616,<span style="color:white">0.342490148</span>,0.647085228]</span>  because of TWO main reasons<span style="color:yellow">:it does</br></br>NOT</br></br>allow for a simple method of voting,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00740193838,0.3217777759999999,<span style="color:white">0.67082029</span>]</span>  and <span style="color:yellow">it does</br></br>NOT</br></br>allow for every vote, and voice to be heard in the United States presidency election, tarnishing this countrys' right of democracy, causing outrages all over the country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0041340564,0.19018552,<span style="color:white">0.8056804399999999</span>]</span> </br></br>To initialize this one-sided argument, <span style="color:yellow">lets begin with an important factor that the electoral college cannot be trusted on achieving, the fact that every vote counts</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0066140620799999,0.268244436,<span style="color:white">0.725141508</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">With over 300 million people now in the United States, under a unified country that promotes and exemplifies democracy, we have not been democratic in the sense that peoples vote doesnt even go to their president, only to another mind that can cast you away as if you were not important. As stated in Par. 7 Source 1 an article by the Office of the Federal Register "Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate." These are the minds that are sometimes chosen at random, or by other factors to represent you, a choice you werent allowed to make. The winner takes all method only takes away from states like Texas and California who know their vote doesnt matter because these people will always agree on democratic or republican, and what is currently used in our society. This damages thousands of voices, thousands of votes that could have matter, but seemingly don't. Just like  how schools have implemented the 'No Child Left Behind' policy, we should transcribe this to leaving no american citizen without a voice, only dependant on what state their in.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0028997949399999,0.053828513,<span style="color:white">0.9432717</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Theories on how a single vote doesn't matter have been given, as stated in Par. 23 Source 3 by Richard A. posner "Voters in the presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.",</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.00626631118,0.235937092,<span style="color:white">0.757796598</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">who also comes to contradict themselves originally with "Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43% Percent plurality".

Something that can be fixed easily by one thing: overriding, fixing, and changing our way to popular vote.
