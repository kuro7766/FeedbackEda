<span style="color:white">How i feel about this article talking about having a piece of technology that could show and tell you what people are feeling is pretty crazy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Ok with starting this off i would say that i am against this</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because yeah it would be cool to see peoples emotions and see how people are feeling</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but i think it is bad because teachers for example would use it whenever and espically when a student is mad or acting strange or if the teacher and student got in an argument.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The teacher would use it to see how they where feeling and with one other thing if a student is texting under his lap or something is smiling or showing some type of motion a teacher could have the machine read what they are feeling about during that time to even hundred percent know kids where on there phones that could be a good thing for teachers but bad for students and that would make students even more mad or anything towards school or teachers</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">i think something to let you see emotion would be bad to have in school because you don't need to no how people are feeling its not your buisness to know.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">And to sum this all up in my conclusion to the essay of the article is that it would be cool to see something like that but not in school and they should have it set up in places where people could go in public. And try not in schools or places that need it like hospitals or places for crazy people just not school the end.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
