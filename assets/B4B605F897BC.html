These are all things that could lead to a fatal crash. For example, "Further improvments in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own." Drunk driving will also become a thing of the past and save more lives than anyone could even imagine. A driver less car can also utilize some of the cars capabilities that a human can not access. "The information from the sensors can cause the car ti apply brakes on individual and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0123131242,0.2197360119999999,<span style="color:white">0.767950838</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The idea of driverless cars is a great idea because the envirnment will benefit from it greatly and human error on the roads will become a thing of the past.
