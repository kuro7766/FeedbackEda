<span style="color:yellow">Driverless cars could be the way of the future or end up being the worst invention humans have ever fabricated. Driverless cars is a very good idea that could change the world for good.

Crash rates will go down so there will be less debris on the road.

These are all things that could lead to a fatal crash. For example, "Further improvments in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own." Drunk driving will also become a thing of the past and save more lives than anyone could even imagine. A driver less car can also utilize some of the cars capabilities that a human can not access. "The information from the sensors can cause the car ti apply brakes on individual and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The idea of driverless cars is a great idea because the envirnment will benefit from it greatly and human error on the roads will become a thing of the past. Technology is advanced enough where we can develope safe and effective ways of getting rid of human error. Driverless cars are a great example of human innovation becomeing a reality. I look forward to see how driverless cars will excel in todays world and how they can improve our lives in the coming decades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective]</span>
