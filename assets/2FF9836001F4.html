<span style="color:yellow">People say not everyone can do what some people can do. A person can be good at something while someone else is terrible at it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I disagree with this decision because you go to school to learn about what you need to know for the future. You don't go to school to learn about sports, or learn how to make yearbooks. You don't go to school to get pushed by someone about something you don't want to do. You should be able to have your own choice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">For instance, I play basketball for my school. I had my own choice of if I wanted to tryout for basketball or not.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Not everyone likes playing basketball like me. I like basketball because when im on or off the court it makes me think about the game not about life or whats happening on the bleachers. I try my best at practice so I can maybe start in a game. You got to work hard for something you want.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Another example is when I get older I want to be a cosmataligist.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Some people may want to be one also. Others might think the opposite. When I was a kid I use to play with doll's hair and watch YouTube videos on how to die hair, cut hair, and also brush hair the right way.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>In both of these examples <span style="color:orange">I was trying to explain that not everyone is the same. You might have the same talent as someone or you may not and thats okay if not. You might want to be the same thingÂ as someone when you get older but someone may want to be the opposite.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
