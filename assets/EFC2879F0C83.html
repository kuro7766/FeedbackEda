Hello, (Insert State Senators name),</br></br>My name is PROPER_NAME.</br></br><span style="color:yellow">A very popular topic that has been floating around in recent political conversations is the process, or in more familiar terms: fairness, in the steps used in the Electoral College to select a President for the United States of America. Or, perhaps ironically so, lack therfore of directly selecting a President. It is this particular topic that has inquired me to send you this letter regarding the upcoming debate: Should the Electoral College Stay Or Go?</br></br>Now don't get me wrong here: I legitimately don't believe anything I say could really have a major impact on any type of consideration towards this debate, I just hope you read this and ponder it's words to fully make a positive choice-whichever path you choose to side with in this.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Our Forefathers created the Electoral College because they believed it to be the best method in securing a true democratic result for the leader of the USA.
