can hear different points of view.</br></br><span style="color:yellow">By asking many people for advice on the situation, you encounter people that are wiser, smarter, and far more experienced than yourself.</br></br>For example, I remember encountering a situation as a fifth grader where I had to choose between saving my money or buying a new gaming system.</br></br>I had been saving this money since fourth grade, and I had accumulated more than four hundred dollars.</br></br>When I went over to my cousin's house, I was able to play on his gaming system, and I thought it was really fun.</br></br>Before I left, I made sure to ask him if I should invest in the same gaming system or to save the money.</br></br>His response was to buy the system.</br></br>Even though I got the advice I needed, I made sure to ask other people the same question.</br></br>Next, I remember asking my parents if it would be worth it.</br></br>My mom had told me that we already had lots of video games.</br></br>On the other hand, my dad told me that it was my money, and if this is what I decided to spend is on, it was completely fine.</br></br>After seeking multiple points of view, I had finally made my decision.</br></br>I was going to buy the gaming system.</br></br>To this day, I still play on that console, and I do not regret my investment.</br></br>After asking many people, you start to see a pattern in answers.</br></br>In my case, I figured out that the majority of people I asked said it was a good idea to buy the console,</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000239290758,0.0115219202,<span style="color:white">0.988238812</span>]</span>  and this leads into my next point.</br></br>Asking many people for advice can also be beneficial because you can determine what the proper choice is by examining what answer people reply most.</br></br><span style="color:yellow">If we go back to my story about whether or not to buy the console, the answer I received most was, "Yes."</br></br>Ultimately, that was a big factor that told me I should buy the console.</br></br>If you ask many people the same question and you get the same answer, whatever they are telling you is probably the smart and correct thing to do.</br></br>It may not necessarily be the decision you were thinking of making, but it may be one to consider.</br></br>Back at the beginning of the school year, my English teacher assigned our class a project where we have to make a difference in our community.</br></br>At first, my idea was to organize a community-wide sports equipment drive.</br></br>When I got home that day, I discussed my idea with my parents, and they told me that was not the best idea, and that we should sit down and discuss a better idea.</br></br>I decided I wanted to prove them wrong.</br></br>Fast forward a couple of months, and I am struggling to get anything done on the project.</br></br>That night, I told my parents that my idea would not work, and they just gave me that "I-told-you-so" look.</br></br>From there, we devised a plan where I would instead help the volunteers on the Blue Ridge Parkway.</br></br>Right now, my project is going great, and I am close to crossing the finish line of completion.</br></br>From that, I learned that you need to take advice of others because, in my case, my parents knew what they were talking about.</br></br>If multiple people tell you that something is not the right choice, then you should probably reconsider.</br></br>That was a life lesson I needed to learn, but from seeking advice from more than one person, you learn many life lessons.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000653038278,0.0389186106,<span style="color:white">0.960428324</span>]</span> </br></br>Last but not least, asking more than one person for advice can teach you very valuable life lessons that will help along the path of life.</br></br><span style="color:yellow">From my experience of failure from my school project, I learned that even though you think your idea sounds good, you should still be open to improvement.</br></br>My decision on buying something I wanted taught me opportunity cost.</br></br>From asking people for advice, you can learn may valuable things that will assist you.</br></br>Not only do these decisions affect a singular situation, but they can be applied to life very easily.</br></br>Now, if I am interested in purchasing anything, I always weigh the options, and ask others what the best thing to do would be.</br></br>I learned that skill from asking people for advice.</br></br>These are the lessons that are learned first hand.</br></br>You do not just read them in a book, but instead, you are taught by experience and others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00250132206,0.189291872,<span style="color:white">0.8082067860000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">After asking for advice from numerous people, you ultimately decide that you want to take your brother with you to Disney World.</br></br>Though those people you did not choose may feel bummed out, you know you made a good, educated choice because you took advice not just from one person, but from many.</br></br>If you had only asked one person, they could have told you to take your grandfather, dog, cousin, son, etc.</br></br>Instead, asking many people gave you a better grasp on the situation, ultimately allowing you to determine the best choice is to take your brother.</br></br>Asking many people for advice before making a decision is a good choice because you can examine other people's opinions on the situation, figure out what the best choice is by finding the most common answer, and learn many life lessons.</br></br>So the next time you face a difficult choice, ask more than one person for advice before coming up with your verdict.</span>
