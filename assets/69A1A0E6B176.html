Colleges care about their image. So as far as the colleges are concerned good students equals good looks and good looks equals more demand college which equals more money. Part of that image is sports, in fact if you are good enough at a specific sport so much that they want you to be on their team they will pay for you to go to their college, this is called a scholarship. The better the students a college gets the more attractive it looks, the more students my high school sends to college the more attractive my high school looks and the students have a higher chance to go to college, its a win, win, win!</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00904210238,0.1215370367999999,<span style="color:white">0.8694208760000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">I feel that it is important in high school to be a part of something like a sport, or yearbook, or student council.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00487472548,0.187364758,<span style="color:white">0.807760582</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The sense of community and common interest in a large group of people can really make you feel at home and be a nice thing to look forward to after a long day of school, even if it might be taxing physically or mentally.
