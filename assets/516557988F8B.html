Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe that the policy of having at least a B average to participate in school sports or activities is the correct thing to do</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . I believe this because, <span style="color:orange">students who don't have at least a B average, or better, won't be able to handle having a good grades in school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They'll either be to busy to not do homework or to lazing to do school work. Or the student will be too sleepy in class. Also the student might not be focusing in school as much as they used to.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>My first reason for this policy to be passed is that, i<span style="color:orange">f the below B average student goes to his or hers sport practices or meetings they would probably neglect their homework and school work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Which would cause the student to get an even lower grade average! Unlike with an A or B student who would always at least try to complete their school work and homework.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Another good reason to pass this policy of yours would be that, <span style="color:orange">the student wouldn't have enough sleeping time</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:white">which again would make them struggle in school even more. If the below B average student was actually worried about their below average gradethey would</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>
