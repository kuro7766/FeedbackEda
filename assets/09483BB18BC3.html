<span style="color:white">The electoral college has existed since the founding fathers established it in the consistution as a way to elect a presedential canidate. What the electoral college is, it is a "compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens." What the electoral college does instead of electing a preseident through a popular vote, it is electing through a electoral vote, that means if you are voting your votes are actually counted towards the electors of the canidates. Each candiate has it's own slate of electors, in wich you are voting for them, and they will make the decision of deciding who is president of the U.S.</br></br>A presidential canidate can have more popular votes then the other candiate, meaning votes favored by the people, but if a president has more electoral votes, which is votes by the electors then they are elected as the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.076743246</span>,0.41939912,0.503857662]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The benefits of the electoral college is this, 1.
