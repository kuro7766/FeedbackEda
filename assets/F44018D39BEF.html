Little Johnny was walking home from school one day when he noticed a gum rapper on the gray sidewalk, he picked it up and threw it in the garbage can. he continued walking home when he saw another gum rapper on the sidewalk. he picked it up and put it in the garbage. a few minutes later he saw another gum rapper on the sidewalk. but this time he was mad so he ignored it. that afternoon he told his mom and dad about what happened after school, and they said it didn't matter, and that it is not there problem. the next day he was walking home from school when he found another gum rapper on the sidewalk, so he pick it up and brought it home to his mom and dad and the all wrote a letter to the major of his town saying that they should pick up all of the trash on the ground. and they did.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br>but all is not bad in this situation. there is a way to solve this problem. <span style="color:orange">first of all, you could do exactly what John did and write a letter to the major stating that every body should pick stuff up. also, you could do what i have been trying tell you wah to do for a long time, tell all of your students to do at least 15 minute of community service.</br></br>over all, i think that students should do at least 15 minutes of community service a day, so that the town is clean.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
