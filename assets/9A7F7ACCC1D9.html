Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I am writing this letter to inform you that requiring all students to perform community service is a great idea</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.01378556334,0.38174302,<span style="color:white">0.604471412</span>]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Even though other students may not like it I'm behind it 100 percent.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.280868866,<span style="color:white">0.594245346</span>,0.1248857766]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The students who don't like it say "it takes too much time away from what they need or want to do"</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.0159262806,0.3655132679999999,<span style="color:white">0.618560474</span>]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">but in truth these are the lazy failing students that don't want to do anything in life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Effective/0.0730926504,0.504434756,<span style="color:white">0.422472622</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Even so there are students who would love the idea and would go for it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0610967802,0.3832599659999999,<span style="color:white">0.5556432800000001</span>]</span>  So I strongly urge you not to fall for teenage peer pressure. <span style="color:orange">I can assure you that the kids who find community service "boring" or "a waste of time"</br></br>will soon see that performing community service will not only help the community, but inspire the world to do the same.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0532550822,<span style="color:white">0.38814528</span>,0.5585996280000001]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Community service can maybe even lead to a greener tomorrow</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0400699416,<span style="color:white">0.43594478</span>,0.523985226]</span> . So please <span style="color:white">Principal don't think twice about not having all students perform community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.322328144</span>,0.570911396,0.1067604548]</span> </br></br>sincerely, very concerned student
