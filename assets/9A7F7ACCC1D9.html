Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I am writing this letter to inform you that requiring all students to perform community service is a great idea</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Even though other students may not like it I'm behind it 100 percent.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The students who don't like it say "it takes too much time away from what they need or want to do"</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">but in truth these are the lazy failing students that don't want to do anything in life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Even so there are students who would love the idea and would go for it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  So I strongly urge you not to fall for teenage peer pressure. <span style="color:orange">I can assure you that the kids who find community service "boring" or "a waste of time"</br></br>will soon see that performing community service will not only help the community, but inspire the world to do the same.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Community service can maybe even lead to a greener tomorrow</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . So please <span style="color:white">Principal don't think twice about not having all students perform community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>sincerely, very concerned student
