The author also states that the planet atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide with highly corrosive clouds. This shows that most metals we have can be melted by the clouds and the temperature at the surface is too much for a human to handle.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.155329517,<span style="color:white">0.8280748160000002</span>,0.01659563788]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Like I said in the intro, If we had the materials to keep a human safe to walk on the planet and take samples.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.34261288</span>,0.65336906,0.00401803126]</span>  <span style="color:white">We would have plenty of things to test here on Earth.
