The question is Electoral or Election. <span style="color:orange">Well i choose election because the election is a better way of letting the oters express their ideas.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.2443146259999999,<span style="color:white">0.7531717800000001</span>,0.0025135915]</span>  In such ways as they could compare and contrast. <span style="color:white">They could also pick wich one they think is the most proficiant</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.601373306</span>,0.397739866,0.000886841404]</span> . <span style="color:white">Unlike the electorals they choose the people that will decide the president so there for they could and may lie to the judges and tell them a certain thing but then do a different thing that is also a well asked questions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.531653136</span>,0.4666427860000001,0.001704094166]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Electoral could have a positive outcome sometimes as such it can have a negative outcome.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.6081254439999999</span>,0.390960734,0.00091382514]</span>  <span style="color:white">Election can also have positive and negative points. But i think that election could have a better chance of succeding because of the voters. Stated in paragraph 11 says ( The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.) well there we have it people are already questioning that choice. Some proses that ties that vote could and may not be acurate.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.666308816</span>,0.3321260119999999,0.001565135346]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Election also has some bad features like some might say its the most basic level but it also is unfair in some ways.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.4776800339999999</span>,0.5205938,0.001726144634]</span>  <span style="color:white">That statement or opinion is based on each individuals point of view. We dont all look at the choices in the same way. That is very important to try to undestand each choice and look at them closely. To be honest i think both have good ideas but election has a better outcome from my point of view.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.8137455819999999</span>,0.1856035772,0.000650807612]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Electoral or Election. I say Election both are extremely simialar but also very different. Deciding a president is very important in any situation. The Outcome of choosing then turning out that it was a miss understanding is very ploral. We have to put the outcomes of both out there and examine each and every one closely.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.727315858</span>,0.271542062,0.001142075922]</span>
