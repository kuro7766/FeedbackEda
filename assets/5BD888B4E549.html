Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I would like to thank u for reading this letter.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I would personally prefer Policy 1, because if the students are responsible then they should be able to use there phones in free time such as lunch hour.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Students should turn cell phones off in any hour of the day in which the are learning. If caught with phone on or still having the same texting conversations as lunch or previous periods then a proper form of punishment should be given. The reasons young adults should be given the choice to bring or not to bring their phones is because they need to know if you make a choice and get in trouble that they need to take the punishment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Policy 2 is an unfair unlike Policy 1 which give us a choice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Policy 2 is like taking an agenda from a hard working lawyer or doctor. It is something they need to make through the day just as young adults need their phones.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Us using our phones help us keep in touch with our parents</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">like on game days and you are supposed to ride the bus and your parents need to find you</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">Now the phone usage on the bus is the same policy as the school. They always have those "NO CELL PHONE USAGE" signs up.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I am coming to you with this letter because i believe students should be allowed to bring their phones to school if they are smart with it. I would most certainly choice Policy 1 but this is just a letter to persuade you.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Again thank you for taking the time to read this letter and for considering Policy 1 in your school.</br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
