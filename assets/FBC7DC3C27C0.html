To Whom It May Concern:</br></br><span style="color:orange">I am writing this letter regarding your policy on cell phones during school hours.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.173217438,<span style="color:white">0.71206093</span>,0.1147216306]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">In my opinion, I believe Policy 1 is the better choice for our school. If cell phones are allowed to be used during free times and lunch, it would have a better effect on the students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.00655886616,0.34910004,<span style="color:white">0.644341084</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">As school goes on, the curriculum becomes more difficult which encourages students to study harder and focus more on getting higher grades. While their grades are very important, this may create stress on some students which may even lead them to get lower grades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0340430916,<span style="color:white">0.574631558</span>,0.391325348]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Permitting the use of students' cell phones during school could possibly reduce the stress they have from being the studious children that they are.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.01534589434,<span style="color:white">0.472907072</span>,0.5117470319999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Having less stress and pressure on them may result in higher marks and eventually an exemplary school. This could benefit the school district greatly and this policy can be spread to other schools so that all of our campuses can be exemplary.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0483887307999999,<span style="color:white">0.64044789</span>,0.3111633747999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Another reason why this cell phone policy could result in a positive outcome for our school is it could maybe even save lives.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0139941081999999,<span style="color:white">0.421063014</span>,0.564942882]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For example, if there is a fatal emergency in the cafeteria that involves choking, a student could simply dial 911 to get an ambulance there as soon as possible.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0448864274,<span style="color:white">0.656504698</span>,0.298608882]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There may be some issues when first putting the policy in order,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0908367861999999,<span style="color:white">0.7213733099999999</span>,0.187789932]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but once students get used to the idea that they are allowed to use their phones during free time only, they won't bother with sneaking any texts during class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.0201011564,<span style="color:white">0.5320230699999999</span>,0.447875778]</span>  <span style="color:orange">To prevent cell phone usage during class, students should be allowed to go to their lockers after lunch to put them away while under the supervision of an administrator. This keeps them from cheating on tests, contacting anyone outside school, and being distracted in class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.104196621,<span style="color:white">0.674498138</span>,0.221305234]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I really believe this change in your school's regulation could help your students develop into a fully grade A campus and be even better than before.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.0521836462</span>,0.719626476,0.2281898266]</span>  I am hoping for your kind consideration.
