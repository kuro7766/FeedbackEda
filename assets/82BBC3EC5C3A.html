Dear, Principal</br></br><span style="color:orange">You should require for all kids to help out on cleaning the school</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> .</br></br>The results for the actions of my fellow student's would be that ,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Our school would be cleaner and then everyone would be proud that they had some part into making the school a better place.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Some Kid's might refuse to help out if so then there should be a consequence.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">And so we don't have conflicts with a group of kids doing more work than other's and would feel used because they did most of the work while other people did part. There Should be a limit on how many pieces of trash or how much space you should clean up, how much time you should help a teacher out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This should not be during school, it would waste your learning time</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">although after school would be good because you wont be disturbing anyone. If it's okay with the parents of the child then we should have community service for the school. Make this after school community service for us kids fun so we wont be bored and feel like if its not out responsibility to clean up and help out</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">For Example You Should Help out to and the deans, give us free dress day's as our reward i guarantee it will make a difference. We Should also re-paint parts of the school that have been tagged up or written on so it can look clean and not as bad as it is.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">This Was My Perspective on what should you do with the community service for kids.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
