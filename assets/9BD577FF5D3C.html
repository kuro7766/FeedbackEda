Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I strongly believe that students should get to have a C average to work in sports or other activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0608512728,<span style="color:white">0.8091141519999999</span>,0.1300345648]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Without this opportunity, many children will lack in physical</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0556776328,<span style="color:white">0.8339522700000002</span>,0.1103701213999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">With a B average, many students may not keep up to that level, which overtime, makes them grow weaker.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0469714812,<span style="color:white">0.7805709239999999</span>,0.1724576159999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Not having activities and sports will hurt people physically, but also mentally. It can cause more stress to student's minds.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0451882638,<span style="color:white">0.7905229159999999</span>,0.1642888314]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Students should get as much physical activity as they want, but if they have to have a B average, then this will make them get worse at what they may do best</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0524047178,<span style="color:white">0.785873576</span>,0.161721707]</span> . <span style="color:white">These people should be getting enough freedom to do an activity for at least a C average. They will lack in physical skills and it may even mess up peoples dreams. If you know most of your students maintain at a C average, then leave them like that</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.2121981147999999</span>,0.7554835540000001,0.0323183549]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Of course, changing the policy might make them work harder</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.100570485,<span style="color:white">0.861393934</span>,0.0380355798]</span> , but <span style="color:white">its just not fair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.317059306</span>,0.671835526,0.01110519716]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Students may see a positive change in there grade average</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.109944611,<span style="color:white">0.8521051319999999</span>,0.0379502592599999]</span> , but <span style="color:orange">if someone likes to play a sport, then there shouldn't be a change in policy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.2164518079999999,<span style="color:white">0.7585966500000001</span>,0.0249515443]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There will be a positive side, but also a negative side to it.

They want to be more social and talk with friends, participate in an activity. All these things help students grow up more healthier in life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1107163828</span>,0.838579966,0.050703658]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Some students may think its easy, but for most, it is hard. Since most of your students have a C average, then there is some bad effects on changing it to a B average</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.224191038,<span style="color:white">0.753626674</span>,0.0221822846]</span> . <span style="color:orange">One important thing is stress</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1361710486,<span style="color:white">0.8184890200000001</span>,0.04533994]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Every student wants to go to school stress free and going to special activities is a huge help in that. If people have to maintain a B average, it can add stress, because they are so caught up into trying so hard to maintain a B average. Stress at a young age may cause students to have a more lonely life. They may not have a social life and be sad most of the time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0644986366,<span style="color:white">0.7921203859999999</span>,0.1433810008]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">As you see, principle, it is a much better idea to keep the policy the same. Students will lack physical education, it will have a bad negative affect, and it causes more stress to students, if sports and activities are only open to B average students. People will not like this new idea because they used to have so much of a good time, but with this, it could possibly change their life a lot.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0791811574,<span style="color:white">0.826358502</span>,0.0944603728]</span> </br></br>From: STUDENT_NAME
