The founding fathers felt it would given congress too much power if it elected the President all by itself. They also felt if citizens chose the seat by themsleves there wouod be chaos. They decided on a nice in between; they both choose, well sort of. What many citizens do not know is that when they cast their vote, they are not voting for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the President.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01671987776,0.218749704,<span style="color:white">0.764530448</span>]</span> </br></br>I myself feel this method is great.

They are not qualified to make choices for the sake of the whole country, that is where the electors come in.

What happens to the people who did not vote for the, "right" candidate? They are forever unheard. Sentenced to live in a community where they are silcenced. I do not agree with the electoral college because agree with our fore father Abraham Lincoln.
