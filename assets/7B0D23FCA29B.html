Meeting different people is one of the ways to clear bad social habits. Because of the fact that they are in the same activity as you, some of them might have the same interests. This can cause you to have new friends, this will help you work with others. Working with others is a good factor when you have an extracurricular, and it's not as hard as opinions might think.
