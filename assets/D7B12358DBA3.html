<span style="color:yellow">As with many students, receiving an education and taking classes is associated with a physical school building. Students are often aware of the two main options for school: attending public/private institutions or home school. Each option offers different advantages and disadvantages but seem to be on opposite sides of a continuum. The option of taking online classes provide the benefits of both attending an in person school and home school. It can be seen as a middle ground on the continuum as taking online classes in addition to regular classes at school may increase learning</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.00213419856,0.1255919179999999,<span style="color:white">0.872273908</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Distance learning benefits students</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.01836286986,0.5110566839999999,<span style="color:white">0.470580428</span>]</span>  as <span style="color:yellow">it can enhance learning</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0036292917,0.295055908,<span style="color:white">0.701314826</span>]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">provide a more comfortable environment</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00322302254,0.2858151699999999,<span style="color:white">0.710961818</span>]</span> , and <span style="color:yellow">give students the opportunity to take classes not offered at school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00259021448,0.24356302,<span style="color:white">0.7538467500000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Online learning can be beneficial to students who have a different learning style.

It broadens the possibilities of how information can be delivered to students and the different class work students can participate in. Online classes can also seem a more appealing option to in person classes, as lessons and assignments tend to be more direct and straight forward. Often times, school teachers give "fluff" assignments that don't necessarily have a purpose or that don't offer much learning potential. These assignments are given to pass time and give students an activity to do whether in class or for homework. I have endured my share of "fluff" assignments throughout high school. During my sophomore year, I despised English class because I didn't seem to gain anything out of it. My teacher would assign miscellaneous assignments such as a food poem or a repetitive packet of work. Online classes tend to include less of these "fluff" assignments because they differ from traditional in person classes where students meet personally with teachers. There is less of a worry to keep students occupied with different assignments each class. With the Generic_School Online Campus, students are given assignments to complete each week with the due date at the end of that week. Teachers tend to give less unnecessary assignments because the class can be more spread out throughout the course.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000626807796,0.0267560212,<span style="color:white">0.972617108</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Taking online classes from home provides students with a more comfortable learning environment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0022942264,0.23410888,<span style="color:white">0.763596904</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">They are in the comforts of their home and have the freedom to attain food or use the bathroom at any given time.

With this option of taking online classes, my education will not be hindered or limited.
