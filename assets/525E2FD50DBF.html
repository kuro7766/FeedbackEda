This mean that most of the states in the south do not get the chance to vote for a presiden and this increases Romney chances of wining, and what if the candidate that wins with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president? The citizens of the United States will feel as if they aren't apart of this country, not giving the rights or freedom this country promised them. The citizens will feel like their votes do not count, when they have there opinion on something the new president will have no interest towards it, this means to us that he isn't really a president.

In the past they agreed on abloshing the electrol college also the article states that "over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now."
