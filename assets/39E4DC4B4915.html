Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I would love it if the electoral college was gone</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.121368037,<span style="color:white">0.829665658</span>,0.0489663202]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">it really is crazy if people are thinking their voting for someone when they really aren't like the presidents.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.3523571159999999,<span style="color:white">0.62637218</span>,0.02127069628]</span>  <span style="color:orange">We actually help pick our state senators because when we vote for presidents we are actually voting for the canidates electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.51437808,<span style="color:white">0.476393734</span>,0.00922820744]</span>  <span style="color:white">Some states have a winner takes all system, and what that system does is awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. But Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation. after the prsidential election, our governor prepares a certificate of asertainment, l isting all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.7408800560000001</span>,0.250739,0.00838095902]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Under the electoral college system, we do not vote for presidents, but for the slate of electors who then elect the president. We should consider ourselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, the system allows for much worst. Consider that state legislaturwes are responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.</br></br>Back in 1960, segregationist in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose for John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, "faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast deciding vote for whomever they plaese.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.4292517,<span style="color:white">0.494441234</span>,0.0763070408]</span>
