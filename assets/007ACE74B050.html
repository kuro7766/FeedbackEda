<span style="color:orange">Hi, i'm Isaac, i'm going to be writing about how this face on Mars is a natural landform or if there is life on Mars that made it. The story is about how NASA took a picture of Mars and a face was seen on the planet. NASA doesn't know if the landform was created by life on Mars, or if it is just a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.081478687,<span style="color:white">0.901193006</span>,0.0173283236]</span>  <span style="color:orange">On my perspective, I think that the face is a natural landform because I dont think that there is any life on Mars.

The reason why I think it is a natural landform because, nobody live on Mars in order to create the figure. It says in paragraph 9, "It's not easy to target Cydonia," in which he is saying that its not easy to know if it is a natural landform at this point. In all that they're saying, its probably a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.24124931,<span style="color:white">0.7507595420000001</span>,0.00799114402]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">People thought that the face was formed by alieans because they thought that there was life on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.312607436,<span style="color:white">0.683711988</span>,0.00368056424]</span>  <span style="color:white">though some say that life on Mars does exist, I think that there is no life on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.341285296</span>,0.6552160600000001,0.0034986476599999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It says in paragraph 7, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time.
