Dear TEACHER_NAME, <span style="color:orange">I don't think we should do community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:yellow">it takes up our time to do things that we need to do</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">It will take our time when we have a lot of homework to do and we don't get it done. It will also take our time because when we want to go shopping or need to go do something it will take our time. If you want us to tutor elementary school children we would have time taken away from learning at school. We have almost the same school hours like them. So we would take our school time away. If we want to we could ask you more about it. I know that helping the community is good and very important but not to spend all your time on it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">I would do community service but not all my time because i want to spend time with my family, get my homework done, and learn more at my school. I want to do fun thing but yet I want to help my community to be a better place. So i kind of go with helping and having our own time. Not all the time i want to do community service and only where we can get all what we have to do and then go to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective]</span> </br></br>By</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
