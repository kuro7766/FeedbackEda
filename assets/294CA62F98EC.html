Dear,</br></br>State Senator</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I believe that the way of voting for a president though the Electoral College is outdated. The popular vote should be deciding who becomes president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.020263826,0.516911732,<span style="color:white">0.46282445</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some Runner-ups have had the backing of the popular vote and not won because of the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0242135323999999,<span style="color:white">0.5422947739999999</span>,0.4334916919999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Several things you should consider is people can actually vote though popular vote</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.048396548,<span style="color:white">0.6998089660000001</span>,0.2517944772]</span> , t<span style="color:orange">he minority will have a better chance</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0588006821999999,<span style="color:white">0.699417814</span>,0.2417815039999999]</span> , and <span style="color:orange">presidents have lost to the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0414607944,<span style="color:white">0.6606874620000001</span>,0.297851724]</span> </br></br>First, People can actually vote, <span style="color:orange">when people go to vote for the next preident or the returning one they arent actually voting for the president they are voting for electoral votes but some state wont even allow people to vote for that. Some states the electors vote for who they want and the peoples votes they are accounting for become nothing. They go out and vote for nothing. " Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana Legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors wiht new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."(source 2) This is what cna happen when poeple can vote who they want and u have electors doing it for them they will put someone in the race that no one wants to really be there.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0320707452,<span style="color:white">0.360931926</span>,0.606997364]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But some poeple say that the Electoral College is there to help us and to help most states have the winner take all system.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0752020686,<span style="color:white">0.69724622</span>,0.227551718]</span>  " <span style="color:orange">The electoral college is unfair to voters</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.0835812225999999,<span style="color:white">0.7717786659999999</span>,0.144640122]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states."(source 2) which means that they won't visit every state because there is no reason to visit some.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0272384298,0.5041052199999999,<span style="color:white">0.4686563439999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Next, The minority will have a chance</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0690686246,<span style="color:white">0.672942276</span>,0.257989095]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">If there ever is a deadlock in the campiagn the voting will have to go to the house which will be mostly filled with the majority side. So the minority won' have much of a chance." Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state." (source 3) that means a close election isn't so close anymore because of Electoral vote. But some people will say u can never get a tie. " A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number."(source 3)</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0319446692,0.339818644,<span style="color:white">0.628236692</span>]</span> </br></br>Continueing on that note, Runner-ups have lost due to electoral vote but have won the popular vote."<span style="color:orange">According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- tanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost preisidency."(source 2) Which means Al Gore would have been president and not the other guy.
