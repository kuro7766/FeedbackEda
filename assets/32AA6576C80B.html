<span style="color:orange">I'm a scientist at NASA and I know that the face is just a natural landform. I have plenty of reasons why that is, and why it wouldn't be an alien. Yes, the face on Mars has become a pop icon, but that doesn't mean people could just assume it's an alien.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0413857426,<span style="color:white">0.8538329920000001</span>,0.1047812846]</span>  <span style="color:orange">NASA has plenty information and data for why it's just a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0480174192,<span style="color:white">0.891121822</span>,0.0608607343999999]</span>  I'll explain my thinking as me being a scientist at NASA.</br></br><span style="color:orange">My first reason is that NASA unveiled the image for all to see.

Those who believe it's an alien, should believe more in miracles. Anything could happen in Mars or any other place around the planet. This is only my opinion, but it sure makes me feel like I'm right about my thinking.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1447034773999999,<span style="color:white">0.8173749499999999</span>,0.0379215637999999]</span>
