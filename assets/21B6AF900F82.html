Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy condiotions but survivalbe for humans." Venus can be suitable for humans, it just would be very difficult starting off. Soon enough humans would adapt to the hostile environment of Venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1684262731999999,<span style="color:white">0.806383616</span>,0.0251901024]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Venus could have to be humanities future if we keep polluting Earth</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.253719822</span>,0.7389498459999999,0.00733031816]</span> . <span style="color:white">Venus could be suitable yet harsh, but still needs to be learned about a lot more.

It's clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acid, and temperatures are averaged over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. It would take a very great amount of effort to make Venus a new home.

It could potentially be a new home. Venus seems to be almost as promising as Mars does right now, but still we need lots of information. The author had very good claims, and I agree with them. If we put more into studying Venus I believe it would help humanity.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0897864935999999,<span style="color:white">0.8768823720000001</span>,0.0333311282]</span>
