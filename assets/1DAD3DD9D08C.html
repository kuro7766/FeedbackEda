<span style="color:orange">Hi, i'm Luke, and one day I was working at the bank and my friend, Don ask "Hey Luke, you want to go to Europe on a cattle boat with me!" How could say no to that type of question? I'v always want to do this.</br></br>The UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of all the horses, young cows, mules that were shiped oversea. Don and I signed up for this adventure!</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br>I loved helping people and animals, and <span style="color:orange">i'm here to say you should sign up and be the best Seagoing Cowboy you can be.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">You get to help other people and animals.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Before I got here I was a small little town boy, and I really never got to experince the majic hidding behind of being a Seagoing Cowboy. I even got a little of the benefit of seeing Europe and China. I also went to Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ridein Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also got to see an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.</br></br>Also, when I help out other people first, it makes me feel good second off it perpares me for hard work along the way of my life. I also got to be a night watchman I did get hurt a little but, before the week was over I was back to work, and better than ever.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I came here to try to explain how much I loved this trip.
