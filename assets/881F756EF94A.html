The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.191216645,0.629805242,<span style="color:white">0.178978103</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">No region has electoral cotes to elect president</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.144447894,<span style="color:white">0.76557412</span>,0.0899779711999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So a solid regional favorite, such as romney was in the south has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful presidat. the residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfrabchished that the new president will have no regard for their intrests, that he really isn't their president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.251107334,<span style="color:white">0.6101593000000001</span>,0.1387333529999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates as we saw in 2012's election</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.2205756639999999</span>,0.70692674,0.0724976047999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">voters in toss-up states are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign. they are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, average and the most thoughtful voters hsould be the ones to dcide the election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.263517196,<span style="color:white">0.686676694</span>,0.0498061124]</span>
