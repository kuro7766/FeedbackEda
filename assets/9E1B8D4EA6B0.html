I would also be scared. There is one " Earth-like " planet. Venus has very dangerous charateristics.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.4735718359999999</span>,0.5235645879999999,0.00286355558]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Venus is the closest plant to earth in terms of density, size, and in distance. Earth, Mars, and Venus all are planetary neighbors. Something Earth is closter to Mars or we are closer to Venus, it just depends on the different speed. Venus is sometimes around the corner, in space terms. We, humans, have sent plenty of spacecrafts to land on cloud-draped world. But none of the spacecrafts have survived the landing less than a day. We havent had a single spaceship land down on Venus in more three decades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.74858466</span>,0.2498869988,0.001528331814]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon diocide covers it. The clouds are th echallenging part because of te sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The temperature is an average of about over 800 dergrees in Fahrenheit. The atmospheric presurre is 90 times greater that what we experince here on Earth. This conditiond are very extreme for us humans can encounter on earth. It also hads the hottest surface of temperture than any plant in our solar system. The geology and weather shows us erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and constant lightning that strikes to the land of the surface. Venus is a very Earth-like plant in our solar system. It is covered with largely oceance and that could suppoort different forms of life, like our plant. It has a very rocky sediment which includes features such as valleys mountians, and craters</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.700575142</span>,0.2963268619999999,0.00309797096]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:white">Venus has a lot of value. We should go out into the solar system and not be scare dof their dangers.
