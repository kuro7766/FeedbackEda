Dear Mr./Mrs. senator</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I beleive that you should consider voting against the electoral college.

If we were to continue to turn our backs on the matter we would soon be run by fatasses who spent all their time gaming and would claim they know exactly how the sytem works, opposed to a real man who spent all his time rising from the bottom up and knows the system by heart.
