If you're home schooled you can watch TV and relax while doing your work at the same time, if you can multi-task.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">But Sometimes it could be a distraction from you doing all your work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">For an example, If you do home school you dont have to worry bout waking up early in the morning.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">People like me are not a morning person. Also if you missed the bus to school and got no transportation you're gonna be stuck at home.
