What's the purpose of having a team with people that don't know what is going on during the games. If the students dont want to play something the shouldn't be forced to do something they don't want to do. Sport require effort to put yourself on the field and not mess up in front of the coach so that you would be able to make the team and not be embarrassed to not see your name ont the paper while eveyone that made it is celebrating.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.25779856,<span style="color:white">0.7273770460000001</span>,0.0148243764]</span> </br></br>In my opinion the student council is not something we should have at our school. <span style="color:white">A lot of the student body gets upset because the president promises something and it never happenes and then it turns in a big rivarly between everyone. We learn abut politics in our geography and i think the us as the student body shouldn't be worried about politics as much because then the student body will think that it is ok to do what the politics do and say.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.69558897</span>,0.302290152,0.00212088294]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion i stated that i strongly disagree because not everyone has the ability to do certain things that others can. I feel that if the students don't want to do extracurricular activites then they shouldn't be made to because they don't want to go out there looking ike a fool or run for president and not make it because they didnt have enough votes. The year book is something that requires a lot of effort and time and not alot of people have pateince to be able to handle what they have to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.176924362,<span style="color:white">0.805757588</span>,0.0173180830799999]</span>
