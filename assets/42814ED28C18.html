What if that person had a death of a family member and wanted to keep it a secret but some random person starts snooping around and tells everyone that that person isn't actually happy. Since the article can tell a fake smile from a real smile it could possibly happen. Now if the person gives you consent then it is fine but nobody should be able to read someones emotion.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Now the thing about the facial recognition being in a classroom might make it more interesting.
