Can we actually "calculate" emotions-like math homework? And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?".</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Technology cannot express feelings to human, so it cannot be used to calculate human emotional expression.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">In technology, the human muscles, 3-D computer model of the face and all major humans muscles are installed in the computer, "The process begins when the computer constructa 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit".

Technology cannot calculate humans expressions because humans emotion and facial expression varies from time to time and based on what there are seeing and feeling at the moment, so technology cannot calculate human expressions. If technology can calculate humans feelings the our phone or other electronics devices should have been able to tell us where we want to go to at a particular moment, and be able to know when calls should come in or not.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
