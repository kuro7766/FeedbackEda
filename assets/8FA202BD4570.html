<span style="color:orange">We humans have been trying to discover aliens for more than a million years. Why have we not found them yet? We have been up in space multiple times and we have had yet another more multipe times sent space robots that went into orbital. So ask your self this question why have we not found aliens yet?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think due to evidence that it is a natural landform</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I think it is a natural landform because in paragraph one it states that "...when it spotted the shadowly likeness of a human face."</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When I read this I then concluded that it only really looked like a human because of the shadows that make up the "eyes, nose and mouth" in which makes this rock figure looking as if it has a face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I do think that is a natural rock landform because God created the earth so that only people would live on earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Also God never created aliens as it states in the begining of Genisis in the bible.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Another example of why that the "face" on Mars is a natural landform is because it states in the text on paragraph seven that "There was no alien monument after all."</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This is poroving that even scienctists have conculuded that there was no landform on mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Then on April 8, 2001 the space station found to "face landform". Though due to the pixalation i think that it did not look like a face anymore. The scientists should have put each photo in the same pixilation because it would have been an accurate demonstration over the years and how this rock landform has formed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Based on the evidence from the article and my past knowleadge I have conculded that this rock landform is in fact a natural landform that aliens have not created/ made this face looking landform. So what do you think?</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
