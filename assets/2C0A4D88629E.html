Dear principle,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe policy 2 is a good choice for a cell phone policy</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">we didn't come to school to talk and gossip with our friends we came to learn.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When most people use there phones, or text there usually talking bad about other people, and hurting there feelings behind there back and not telling them. That's were most people get hurt and verbally abused by who they thought were there close friends, but found out that there not and I think that school is the one place that cell phones should not be aloud to be used.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">All these fancy electronic devices like i pods cell phones and i phones are just distractions</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">and ways to talk to people without actually talking but you will get in trouble if you get caught texting someone during class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So i believe that schools should keep people from having phones at school because some people came to learn and get smart and don't want the distraction of a phone keeping them from learning or doing a good job on tests, quizzes, and home work</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . Even though i have a cell phone and would like to talk to my friends with out other people hearing its best to leave them at home or off in your locker to avoid getting them out during class and getting it taken away. <span style="color:orange">That is what I believe should be the schools cell phone policy because phones are unneeded in a place you are learning at.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
