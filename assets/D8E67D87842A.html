<span style="color:white">Is it a natural formed face or is it made by aliens?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I'm a scientist telling you that it is a natural form rock.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  There are a couple reasons on why it is not made my aliens. It will be provided in the next three paragraphs.</br></br><span style="color:orange">The first reason is, that we here at NASA caught an image of a face in 1976 by viking 1.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">At first we thought it was an alien or a face made by aliens. Then in 2001 we found the same picture of the face, but got a better veiw and a better picture quialty of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the first one. Whe the imaged appeared on JPL web site, reavealing that is was a natural landform, not a face made by aliens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>We did some more tests to be sure that the landform was really a landform or if it was a face made by aliens. We figured out that is was a natural landform.</br></br>That is was not an alien monument after all. We tried to find it again but it was hard.</br></br><span style="color:white">There are no such thing as an alien. This was the reason why there no such things as aliens. We will be doing even more research, thank you.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
