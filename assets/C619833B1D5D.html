Actually, you have me entirely beat on the fact that it simply could be a landform, made by aliens. Yes, there I admit it, sit at home and laugh at the fact that I could be wrong. Look, Mister Whoever reads this for a job, I argue for a living with my friend, and there is simply not enough evidence to actually say that there is no way that this is not alien made. There is actually a chance, somewhere, somehow, a superficially small chance that aliens might have had someplay in this. I know that all sounds crazy, but seriously, think about it. All we have is some lously picture that, while it shows us the exteriror, it doesn't show us anything about the interior of the landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.172241982,<span style="color:white">0.406891588</span>,0.4208664464]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Here is the other side to the point I just made, think about this rationally for a second, could aliens really have made a monument or some strange thing on Mars, only for it to be found by humans?</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.114273899,<span style="color:white">0.652827386</span>,0.23289874]</span>  <span style="color:white">Probably not, and all of this is so improbable that I really don't even need to write an argumentative essay about it anyway.
