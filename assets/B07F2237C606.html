<span style="color:orange">This technology is a good idea to all students in a classroom who is feeling different emotions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The technology is helpful because it can indicate on when a student is feeling,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">for example sad and if the teacher see it they talk to the student and know why is the student feeling happy or sad, angry.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The Facial Action can also be helpful with computers if they know how if we are stuck on something in class like a lesson or or assignment its like what Dr. Huang says or his prediction ''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.''</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  '<span style="color:orange">'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'' This means even on the computer can calculate his or her face them changing their motion or expression.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also, computers can calculate how you change your muscles to indicate which emotion your feeling at that moment</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">like in the article it talks about how your muscles movements move, ''For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when your're surprised; your obricularis oris (around your mouth) tightens up your lips to show anger.'' This shows that with these movements of characters it can show what kind of emotion a student is feeling in a classroom.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also, this technology isn't what probably students want in a classroom because</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">some students probably dont want their faces to be be modify or sometimes some students dont have no emotions like in the article it says ''The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,'' observes Dr. Huang, ''even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression'' this means that the someone probably have little emotions or expression in their face. In classrooms students who are bored show it mostly with body language which makes the face change expressions if the lesson is boring</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> .
