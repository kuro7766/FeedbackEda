Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br>Hello , my name is STUDENT_NAME. I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME. <span style="color:orange">I've heard that you were changing the school policy , and that you wanted to hear from the students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.2399473879999999,<span style="color:white">0.7455702879999999</span>,0.0144823293999999]</span>  I would love for you to take the chance to read my letter . Thank You</br></br>As I stated before <span style="color:white">I've heard about the changes you want to make and I have a lot of suggestion on it</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.352830254</span>,0.635499892,0.01166986208]</span>  . One of them is that may be <span style="color:orange">after school programs is the only way some of the students stay out of trouble</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.054441955,<span style="color:white">0.904855378</span>,0.0407026514]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So then with you taking that away from them, they will have nothing else to do . Then they will turn to the streets, and i know you wouldn't want that for our fellow students .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1146801111999999,<span style="color:white">0.8486801140000001</span>,0.0366397618]</span> </br></br>Also <span style="color:orange">may be them getting a C grade average is the best they can do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.158818566,<span style="color:white">0.8196160459999999</span>,0.0215654004]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Then our school wouldn't have the best after school activities we could have. Then the people who enjoy it the most , but doesn't meet the standard wouldn't have the ability to get a scholar ship in it even if they need it the most.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.195960978,<span style="color:white">0.7707527599999999</span>,0.0332862922]</span>  Another reason is that, <span style="color:orange">without after school activities students wouldn't really be able to work out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0808696754,<span style="color:white">0.882576708</span>,0.0365536219999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Then we would have even more students turning obesity.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.298670406,<span style="color:white">0.69133512</span>,0.00999447328]</span> </br></br>I would really like to thank you for reading my letter and giving my suggestions a thought . I hope you really think about them. Also and try not to just take our activities for granted. Once again thank you.</br></br>Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
