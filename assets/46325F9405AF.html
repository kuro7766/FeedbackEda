In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.</br></br>The "Face on Mars" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0991189628,0.806595258,<span style="color:white">0.0942857741999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This article it also states that the "Face on Mars" is really just a mesa</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0810731967999999,<span style="color:white">0.897881824</span>,0.0210449851999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Which proves that the so called "face" is not a face and it is just a landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1119467919999999,<span style="color:white">0.876743154</span>,0.0113100733999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Others still thought it was a face.
