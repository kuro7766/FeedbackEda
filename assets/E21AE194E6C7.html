The car could be a succesful invention. Then again it could be a failure. Nobody wants to be in harms way right? In the passage it says " Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020" to me I think it will take more than four years to invent these cars and mass produce them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.4811720579999999</span>,0.515452502,0.00337543386]</span> </br></br>To me driverless cars has many pros and many cons.

To me the maufacturers are just looking to make money.</br></br>To me as a person i take safety very serious. I think the safety concept of the vehicles should be one of the more serious things the manufacturers should look at if produced. They should only give a certain amount of driverless cars out incase the technology fails. There won't be much chaos if the technology malfunctions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.4208367899999999</span>,0.5713555960000001,0.0078076378799999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Driverless cars are the future for the world.

If the driverless cars will have sensors then what's the use for the person to have to be cautious at all times for? Like i've said before I take safety very serious and I hope the maunufacturers take it more serious for the future of the "autonomous car."</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.118643054,<span style="color:white">0.8577747519999999</span>,0.02358218046]</span>
