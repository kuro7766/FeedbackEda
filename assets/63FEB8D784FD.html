<span style="color:orange">In these 3 sources they're talking about electoral college, I beileve electoral college is a good and smart way to handle elections. AN electoral college is a process made by the founding fathers and they estabilshed it in the constitution.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0904280714,<span style="color:white">0.8858866299999999</span>,0.0236852712999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some people planned on abolishing it, I think thats and i'll show you why.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.4530424079999999,<span style="color:white">0.543225972</span>,0.00373163148]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">First,I beileve they should not abolish it because its so origanal and whats the reason it needs to be abolished.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.259318434,<span style="color:white">0.734868824</span>,0.00581273934]</span>  <span style="color:white">They're probably planning on making a new system or doing it for a personal matter. Either way, its all depending if the congress and the president himself to agree on this.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.6154365900000001</span>,0.382671316,0.0018920915519999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Overall abolishing a this from the constitution where its been for too long is wrong. Even though this method is not democratic its still not right to abolish this from the constitution.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.429538848,<span style="color:white">0.56803259</span>,0.00242854848]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">And, I also know why they are some reasons why they wouldn't want this method to be here. In source 2 it stated "voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of the electors". Everything depends on the state because it decides most of the voting standards of the whole state.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.214422172,0.767379108,<span style="color:white">0.01819875156</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This method can also defy the will of the people, sounds anti-republican and just wierd for legislatures to screw with the votes you jotted down. This practictly almost made JFK not a president apparently he got lucky. Richard Nixon voted aand validated his predidency</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.1849256219999999,<span style="color:white">0.798273348</span>,0.0168010367399999]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:white">In a nutshell, electoral college has its upsides and downsides and is still up today. I beileve its an easy thing to say it all depends on opinion and beilefs.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.429301136</span>,0.566659714,0.00403915936]</span>
