<span style="color:yellow">Lets talk about abolishin the electoral college. When you vote, do you think you vote for the president? No. When you vote u dont vote for the president you vote for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

In 2012 President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, says in source 3: In defence of the Electoral College. My point here is that we "DO NOT" need the Elecoral College.
