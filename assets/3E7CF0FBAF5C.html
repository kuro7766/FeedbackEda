<span style="color:white">Studying venus would be really interesting but venus is hard to study because it´s dangerous and it has really high pressure.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Venus is sometimes known as earth´s twin because venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Scientist have tried to get to get numerous spacecrafts on venus but no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Venus is one of the hardest planet to study and research. It´s hard for astrounauts to go to venus because temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what humans experience on our own planet.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If NASA sent humans to venus it would be really hard for the astronauts to land because it has hostile conditions on the surface of venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When the humans would land on venus the air pressure would be close to some of the levels in the sea and the temperature would be toasty.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, venus has challenging things it presents and it would make it very hard for people in NASA to put human life on a planet that has very high air pressure and temperature that we are not used having on earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
