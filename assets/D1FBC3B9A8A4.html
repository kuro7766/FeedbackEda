To Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that community service is not a waste of time, because people care about where they live.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They want to keep it clean so that when family and relatives come over and visit they might want to stay a little bit longer because parts of the city is so clean. Also, it gives a good reputation to the city. Then big time celebrities would want to stay in the city for a little bit if they have a concert or something like that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Community service is a good idea because it makes you feel better about yourself when you go somewhere and you see that the city is all clean.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Also if kids do community service then they will also have a good reputation,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because you will be one of the kids that helped make the city look good.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Other kids don't want to do community service because they think it is a waste of time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They would rather sit on the couch every day eating potato chips and watching T.V instead of going outside and working and helping your community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Community service can build friendships and help bond with your family and spend time with them more.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">But instead of making all the students do community service, you should make it were you give kids do community service for extra credit for some of their classes that their struggling with.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:white">That will help them a lot.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">But some kids think that it is just a waste of time and they say that they have more important things to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also I think that we need to start a community garden.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think it is a good idea, because everybody can just help out and talk to each other and make new friends. We can grow plants together. And when vegetables and fruit are ready to be picked we can take them home and someone can make a pie</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>
