Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electoral College is not what it used to be, its not the most effecent way anymore. The people should decide this time, I am not saying get rid of it. But we should change it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">There are many people who agree with me</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Over sixty percent of the vters would like a more direct system of voteing (according to a Gallup poll in 2000). And so did Ritchard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and AFL-CIO.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The main reason why people want a change is for all the qurks in the Electoral College system.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">For example, if you lived in Texas. And you wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electoers. Witch in most cases would be O.K., but they could betray the party and vote for whom they please. It doesn't always happen but the possibility is real.  And people, like the segregationists back in 1960, could have gone agenst their party and pick electors to go agenst Kennedy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">All we want is a change, it deosn't have to rewrite the Constitision. But the Electoral College must go.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>  We can make it happen.
