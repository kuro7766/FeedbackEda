When there is that little of a gap in between votes, that is the reason why people win national popular vote over electoral votes right there. People should obviously get the president that they want their country to be watched over by, but there should be a little change in how that president comes to be.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.363985166,<span style="color:white">0.604742266</span>,0.0312725835]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">To be president, you need to catch the peoples eye and try to do great things for your country. People who vote for you, obviously want you to be there president and have you take care of them. When you win the electoral college votes, but lose the national popular votes, that means you have lost the election. This is another reason why the winner-takes-all majority vote for the electoral college should be taken off of the table.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.19317796,<span style="color:white">0.723504672</span>,0.083317366]</span>
