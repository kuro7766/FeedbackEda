Voters don't vote for the president they would have to vote for a a slate of democratic electors pledged to that person and if that person won they would go to congress and that runner would get that amount of electoral votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">But if a tie happens the electrol vote would go to the house of representatives where they would have to decide who the president will be and senates would decide who the Vice President would be.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">But in all my oppionion should be that who ever has the most popular vote will vbe prsedent.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Thank You ,</br></br>PROPER_NAME
