Dear State Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I understand there has been some contreversy between keeping or changing the Electoral College by popular vote for the president of the United States</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">But We need to Keep the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> , and these are the reasons why.</br></br><span style="color:orange">First things first, the Electoral College is a process,not a place. Also it consists of 538 electors but a majority of electoral votes needs to be 270 votes in order to elect a president. So each Canident has a 50/50 chance of winning or losing. The elctors are chosen by the political parties, which i can see how people would have a problem with that,bu</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> t <span style="color:orange">if they dodnt choose the canadents for us we probably would even know which person to elect as a canadent.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The presidental election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, giving the citizens more than enough time to decide if they are happy with the president they have or if they should elect a new one,</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">usually there happy with the president they elected which means that the Electoral College process is working</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">Although the electorla college system is for the voters to vote for a slate of electors to elect the president the citizens still get a say in the election towards there president of choice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">if the citizens could just elect a president from there personal votes then they would probably make the wrong decsion on who to choose, they might be fooled by the flashy ads on tv promising change when in reality, there promises are lies. Thats why having a slate of electors help to vote for a president if so important because they know how to point out there lies and know what there true intentions are</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">Some say that the Electoral College system is 'Unfair' to the people but i strongly disagree. Infact, the Electoral College helper the people choose the right president for our country</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
