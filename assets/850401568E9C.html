I know that many people such as, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFC-CIO agree with me on this. For instance, in the second passage on the first paragraph, it says that and much more. "They're not alone [Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter...]; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore - thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College - won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now." Suggesting by what this satement says, a lot of people disagree with our system of election</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00679309886,0.12970432,<span style="color:white">0.8635025720000001</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">We should be able to vote directly ourselves and not have electors do it for us.

But it has changed more than you think.  In article one in the 6th paragraph, it tells exactly how the Electoral College is run. "The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in Novemeber. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors." This paragraph is saying that the person you vote for is basically supposed to be voted for by his electors. In the second  article, what the author is saying is that even though this certain person will get popular vote, they won't agree with it and they'll go against the votors decisions. This isn't the right thing, obviously. I'm sure that no one knows for a fact that's true though. Even though, this is still a messed up way to vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0100260902599999,0.1190213532,<span style="color:white">0.870952534</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">This country is about freedom and the right to do what we'd like, as long as it's rational. This is not rational. We need to be able to vote independentley.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0163972116,0.286753748,<span style="color:white">0.6968490499999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">There are many things wrong with this aspect of our government.

"Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes." This makes us realize that we don't know who, for a fact, the electors are. It also shows that we don't know who the electors will vote for. Usually, they would probably vote for the person that were made to vote for.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0071220701,0.1347319832,<span style="color:white">0.8581459280000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">None of us know what goes on in the Electoral College.

"After the presidential election, your governor prepares a "Cerificate of Ascertainment" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors."  This is just them saying who was all voted for and who all ran. It also says who the electors were. They give us this probably just to notify us but maybe it's also an idea to make us think that Electoral College is proud to help us get who we want.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0608577868,0.326961248,<span style="color:white">0.6121809519999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">As I have said through this whole letter, we deserve to directly vote for our President.
