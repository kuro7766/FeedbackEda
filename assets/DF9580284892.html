When people want to ask for ideas or advice, they sometimes go ask more than one person. <span style="color:yellow">Asking more than one person is better than asking just one person.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">If you ask one person for advice its not the best because you are only getting one idea.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">If you ask more than one person like 10 people than thats better because you have lots of different ideas and opinions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In my opinion asking more people is better because i get multiple opinions to help[ me make a better choice. If you feel comfortable asking just one person then do it, but having multiple opinions will help you make a better choice. So lets say you want to get advice on how to get a girlfriend. You go to your best friendsÂ house and ask him, hey whats some advice or tips on getting a girlfriend and he gives you some advice and tips. Then you go and ask your parents, elders, teachers, and more friends and they all give you a bunch of ideas and opinions on how to get a girlfriend.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  Those are my thought on why its better to ask more people than just one person.
