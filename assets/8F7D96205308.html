The face probably was not a face, it could have been another Martian mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">A rock os some type could have hit it or a meteor could also. Next, NASA took pictures of it, and NASA was researching it and studying it, so they can get more information on it. After studying it, they took a picture of it, and they engaged the public with it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">People started to have debates about the picture and what it could have ment. "Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence pof life on Mars." The others are trying to protect it so NASA could be a little bit safer. The picture did look like an Egyptian Pharaoh</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">NASA said it was a "huge rock information" because it is very similar to a human's face. Next, you cannot just asumed the planet was made from aliens because there is a human's face on it.

Another thing is that there is human's face on it, can mean life on the planet, Mars. Also the rock or the artifact does have an Egyptian Pharoah, it could mean a human was at one point up there.
