<span style="color:orange">Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during break. Should these projects be student or teacher choice? Are the students able to create their own? Students summer break is their time ,so why not let them keep it that way?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0615840883999999,<span style="color:white">0.6820153840000001</span>,0.256400538]</span>  <span style="color:orange">These summer projects should be student-designed,</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0531231437999999,<span style="color:white">0.78350919</span>,0.1633676499999999]</span>  due to <span style="color:orange">an increase in the practicality</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0449465452,<span style="color:white">0.7386968359999999</span>,0.216356656]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">creativity of the project completion.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0474309865999999,<span style="color:white">0.7408481639999999</span>,0.211720842]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Summer break, the time for pool parties and vacation for students: to get away from school.

Furthermore,the creativity and the practicality of the project completion if it is student-designed is leaps and bounds more then that of the teacher designated summer assignment. This is why summer time is the students time to play,create ,and designate.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0315860528,<span style="color:white">0.7001936260000001</span>,0.268220328]</span>
