I can relate to another "alien" sighting. A comet passing earth was thought to be a triangular UFO</br></br>but the telescope took three different pictures at once and gave it that UFO shape.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Secondly, The land erodes over time</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The land could have eroded land could cause a "face" to appear. This "face" is nothing more than a simple act of nature and its way. In the top picture over time you can see it erode away, especialy the 1998 photgraph.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Thirdly, We see things that look like faces everyday, wether its clouds or land formations.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">We see our faces everyday, so its easy to compare. In the top picture you can see a land formation, but scince we know what a face looks like its easy to compare to. In the picture, yes we can see some definition but its still just a land form. For example the man in the moon, it looked like a face but wasn't.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">On the other hand, it might be.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Most theorists claim it appears to be an Egyptian Pharoh. The theorists also claim that the martians built the pyramids. It's a theory but it might be possible.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, No it is a natural landform. <span style="color:orange">It could be a computer image hicup</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">The land erodes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There are a lot of things that are natural and look like faces.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">But, it still might not be natural</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . If it is unnatural then there could be other life out there.
