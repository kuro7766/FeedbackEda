But you never know if that person is doing something they have to be looking at or working on. For example say i am playing a game. But i have to do a review over the game fro a project. That probably would make me frustrated because the computer think im bored or confused and have an ad appear.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.2848697939999999</span>,0.7082311000000001,0.00689910158]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Again, I am not agaist the idea of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. "A clasroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." It is acually cool to know that a computer know how you feel. Once again i do not feel like a computer should change the screen just because they see you not happy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1402946319999999,<span style="color:white">0.851399768</span>,0.00830559686]</span>
