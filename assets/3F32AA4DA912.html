The Mars Global Surveyor captured photos of what the Face looks like from above Mars. The image shows a landform on the planet that seems to look very much like a face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1324102758,<span style="color:white">0.842385886</span>,0.02520383712]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Face on Mars is scientificly known to be a landform in the planet.

That's why many people believe that the lanform is was actually made by aliens. Do you know how there are craters on the moon? If so the "Face" is almost like that but instead of the crater going in, it's pushing outward. That is the easiest way to describe it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1680437168,<span style="color:white">0.8080893079999999</span>,0.023867002]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So far NASA has not found aliens to be real.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.16238355,<span style="color:white">0.8177224799999999</span>,0.01989394114]</span>  <span style="color:orange">That doesn't meant that they aren't real. It just means that the face is highly unlikely to be made by aliens. But one day if NASA does discover aliens that might be a possibility that the "landform" was made by aliens. But until that day comes around it will just be considered a landform based on scientific facts.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2144689259999999,<span style="color:white">0.768691466</span>,0.0168396384]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The first spacecraft to see this landform was NASA's Viking 1 in 1976. Then 18 years later, on April 5, 1998, the MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time. The picture that the MOC was 10 times sharper than the orginal Viking photos. This became very popular at that time in the past. The Face was used in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.299027412</span>,0.6801373740000001,0.0208352139999999]</span>  <span style="color:white">These things started all the talk about the face being created by aliens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.300633262</span>,0.6922823419999999,0.00708437982]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So in all the Face was not made by aliens at all. It just happens to be a natural landform in the shape of a face. I can see where everyone got mistaken but the facts are that it was not made by aliens. So now you will be able to say that you know a lot of things about the Face on Mars! That is everything that I can explain to you about the Face on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.068035394,<span style="color:white">0.8645967420000001</span>,0.0673678482]</span>
