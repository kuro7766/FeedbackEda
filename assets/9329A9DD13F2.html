<span style="color:yellow">Parents are always looking for new ways to give their student the best education possible, but for some, the options available are not suitable for their student.

Classes at home would allow more flexibility for these students. In all cases, the ability to be at home would also allow these students to work when convenient, whether it is when they are feeling better or they have down time on a trip. Students should still be allowed absences in certain circumstances. If they miss a class, rather than having all of their work piled up and having to schedule time with each teacher, they can do the work from home, not having to worry about the schedules of anyone but themselves. A great example is students with poor immune systems that get sick quite often. Depending on the severity of the illness, students who are home sick could attend classes without the fear of contaminating others or getting exposed to worse germs, and allow them to avoid a place that houses countless bacteria and viruses that could cause an illness at any time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000301142804,0.0243918508,<span style="color:white">0.97530697</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Not only this, but on a day that a sick student stays home from school, they often have periods of feeling better and having more energy, so these periods could be utilized for working on classwork, a luxury that is not available in a school building. If this same student were taking classes at school and missed an assessment in class, they would have to schedule time outside of that class and coordinate to find a time that is available for both them and their teacher to make up the work. However, if this student missed an assessment that was online, they would be able to make it up any time that they are free, not having the restrictions of seven hours of a tight packed schedule or specific times in the day</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00050867956,0.04265898,<span style="color:white">0.95683233</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Distance classes would allow for less absences and missing work, improving the experience of both students and teachers.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.001406572832,0.177960386,<span style="color:white">0.82063302</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Some adults may be concerned that at home learning would deprive students of face to face interaction on a daily basis</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0043587255399999,<span style="color:white">0.28125562</span>,0.714385634]</span> , <span style="color:orange">but for some students, these interactions cause unnecessary stress that hinders their learning</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.00387166862,<span style="color:white">0.29152307</span>,0.7046052599999999]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Anxiety is becoming increasingly more common and that anxiety is often caused by social interactions. For students with such stresses, asking questions in class and asking teachers or fellow students for help is very difficult. The ability to ask such questions online will make them more comfortable and able to learn.

Some students learn best by taking notes, while others learn by doing hands on activities. Some students can hear something once and be able to understand fully, while others take more time to process. At home classes gives students the ability to take the time they need to learn material and complete classwork. One student may only have to listen to a teacher lecture and take little to no notes to understand a topic. Another student may need to listen, take extensive notes, and reread or write their notes in order to gain a fraction of the understanding, but they are not able to do this in class. If the expectation in a class is that you are able to complete an activity after 30 minutes of a teacher talking, but that is not how some students learn, those students will be lost and fall behind the others. With classes at home and online, they would be able to take the time they needed to grasp a topic before moving on to use what they just learned. At home learning allows students to practice the learning style that helps them learn the best.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00141243368,0.130189954,<span style="color:white">0.8683976120000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Distance learning should be an option for students because they are able to stay on top of their work when they are not at their best, have a learning environment that works well for them, and have the time needed to learn material. Just like any other new way of learning, there are concerns, but the benefits of distance learning greatly outweigh those concerns. This type of learning is only one of the many options for parents and students to choose from in order to get the best education and though it may not be best for some students, that should not take away the option from others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0027461452399999,0.274555582,<span style="color:white">0.722698278</span>]</span>
