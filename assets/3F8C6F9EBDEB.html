Wooster. I turned 18 when we finally made it to Greece wich meant that I could be drafted for military servrice. By the time I was discharged in 1947 I had made nine trips,the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">When I was a little boy,helping out on my aunt Katie's farm had prepared me for hard work,but not from the dangers at sea.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">On my second trip I served as night watchman. My job was to check on all the animals every hour every night. One rainy night after making my hourly report to the captain I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as I shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal aalong the edge stopped my slide keeping me from flying overboard into the dark Antlantic.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I found time to have fun on board</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> ,especially
