dear principal, 2-7-11</br></br><span style="color:orange">The b average requirement should not be revised. These extracurricular activities should only be allowed for the students who try the hardest in their classes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Those students have earned themselves this and shouldn't share them with people that have anything less than a b average</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">This is coming from a middle school student who takes algebra 1 in 8th grade and is recommended for English honors for high school next fall.

I bet i will go to a d1 university hopefully at NOTRE DAME for a starting wide receiver or cornerback position. In order to go to that prestigious d1 university you have to have a 4.2 gpa and a hell of a top football player in the country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>from,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
