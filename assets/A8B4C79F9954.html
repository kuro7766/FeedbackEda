Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I have to say I do not agree on this possible policy change. I believe children who have grades below a B average should still be able to participate in school sports and other activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.029160584,<span style="color:white">0.753149872</span>,0.217689541]</span>  <span style="color:white">B' s are considered above average. What about the average people, who really are trying? Can't they still do what they want to do? C' s are considered average</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.402509436</span>,0.579162814,0.0183277661999999]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">I believe that "average" people with "average" grades should still have the opportunity to play in sports and other activities</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0469527538,<span style="color:white">0.7967794880000001</span>,0.1562677576]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I can see how you think that sports may lower their grades even more, being too much of a distraction</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0867610286,<span style="color:white">0.8394857219999998</span>,0.0737532524]</span> , but <span style="color:orange">I know that physical activities are something that help the development of your body.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.1124560169999999,<span style="color:white">0.8309660260000001</span>,0.0565779399999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Most Children have at least 4 to 5 hours after school to choose what they want to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1139028811999999,<span style="color:white">0.818635128</span>,0.0674620122]</span>  <span style="color:white">Even when these children are done with their homework they have free time and have the choice on what to do, which usually leads to T.V., video games, eating, computer... exedra. I think if these few extra hours lead to sports, it would be okay. If kids take the time and put in the effort to fit in sports and schooling in one schedule, I think that everything would be great</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.191763709</span>,0.6892906919999999,0.1189455775999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">School was never easy and sports never made it any easier, but at least these kids will experience something they may have been dreaming of doing for a long time. I propose that children with a C average or above in our school should be able to participate in activities and sports.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0893103849999999,<span style="color:white">0.8128463680000001</span>,0.0978432392]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>Anonymous
