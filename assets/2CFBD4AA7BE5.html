Making friends with the people that do the same extracurricular as you can have a lot of benefits. Take this for example; I play football and my friend Generic_name doesn't. So when I try telling Generic_name about the struggles that I am going through on the football team or something important about the team, he can't help me with my problem because he is not involved. But, if I have a friend on the team then he can help me with my problems and I can also help with his or her problems. Overall, extracurricular activities help make friends that can help you through things.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0314606314,0.415178904,<span style="color:white">0.553360498</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Some extracurricular activities help out the school and the community a lot.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0457588984,<span style="color:white">0.716508936</span>,0.237732178]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It may be in a small way but it still helps.
