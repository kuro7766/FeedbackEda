dear principal of our school, <span style="color:yellow">community service should not be required in school,</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">this is because some people who do not have a lot of time on their hands would go crazy trying to perhaps juggle school projects, homework, out of school jobs that take up most of their day.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">So tell me how all of our students who do all of these things and then would have to put community service on top of that i think not Mr. principal sir. that is just wrong.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Now for someone who never does their school work does not have a job and just sits around on their lazy butts all day long those are the people that should be doing community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">not the people that work as hard as they possibly can all day and barley have their eight hours of rest shouldn't be doing it the "other guys should".</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">So what I am thinking is to go to every teacher in the building and see what students work there hardest and what students don't and try to see who have after school jobs and who doesn't. and the people who do not work hard all day every day they should be the students doing community service not the hard working students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br>Thank you , anonymous source
