<span style="color:white">A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus, its even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric aciod in venus's atmosphere. it is usually 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and sometimes the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experince on our own planet. All thought these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth.</br></br>Also venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in our solar system. Even though mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcannoes powerful earthquakes are frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.</br></br>NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. For an example some simplified electronics made of slilcon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. These devices were first envisioned in 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war II. Modern computers exidting in those days may sound schoking but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all.</br></br>Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value not only because pf the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.868748088</span>,0.120999941,0.01025199463]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">In conclusion venus has many dangers ways and it is very hot planet. its very hard to study</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.420095494</span>,0.5750617140000001,0.0048427778]</span>
