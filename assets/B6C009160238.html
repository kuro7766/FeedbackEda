Dear State Senator,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I understand that there have been some issues regarding whether or not to keep the Electoral college or to change the system to a more simple- election by popular vote. From my understanding, the Electoral College has worked for many years with no issues or roadblocks so to speak that have interfered or had a bias on these decisions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.028382151,0.482103564,<span style="color:white">0.48951428</span>]</span>  But, from my recent discovery <span style="color:orange">it might not be as well thought out and fair as we thought.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.071137026,<span style="color:white">0.799658276</span>,0.12920471]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I was just informed that i'm not really voting for the president, i am voting for the official voter that will then, in turn vote for the president(Using their own biases).</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0908111896,<span style="color:white">0.7185717580000001</span>,0.1906170479999999]</span>  <span style="color:white">Since i was not aware of this, i am quite shocked.
