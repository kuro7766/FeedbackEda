Dear State Senator,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I understand that there have been some issues regarding whether or not to keep the Electoral college or to change the system to a more simple- election by popular vote. From my understanding, the Electoral College has worked for many years with no issues or roadblocks so to speak that have interfered or had a bias on these decisions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span>  But, from my recent discovery <span style="color:orange">it might not be as well thought out and fair as we thought.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I was just informed that i'm not really voting for the president, i am voting for the official voter that will then, in turn vote for the president(Using their own biases).</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Since i was not aware of this, i am quite shocked. I'm assuming that this is just something that gets passed by or not looked at very deeply, but i willbe that person that digs down and gets all up in the business of somone other than myself.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">This is offical: The electoral colllege is unfair, oudated and irrational.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without a basis in reality.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Yes, The electoral college does avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">but, either way the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state anyways.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Thank you for your time,</br></br>PROPER_NAME
