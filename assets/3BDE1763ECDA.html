<span style="color:orange">One of the brightest points of light in the night sky is the "Evening Star' which is also a close planet to us called Venus. Venus might seem harmless and pretty from a distance but when you get close it can be really dangerous. The conditions of Venus are hazardous to us. In fact we have had past missions that were never recorded becuase not a single mission succeded. However, NASA is trying to come up with technology that can survive these conditions so we can study Venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.097038566,<span style="color:white">0.764252462</span>,0.138708969]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The closest planet to Earth in density, size, and sometimes distance also is, in fact, Venus.

The fluffy clouds are really just sulfuric acid in the atmosphere on Venus. The temperature on Venus is an average of 800 degrees Farenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth. Because of these harsh conditions the several missions to Venus were remain unknown because no spacecraft was able to survuve the landing for more than a few hours leading to us not being able to collect samples of the materials on Venus's surface.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.152615238,<span style="color:white">0.781196008</span>,0.0661887342]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Despite the harsh conditions and the unsuccessful missions, we could still be able to study Venus</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0638136596,<span style="color:white">0.86052623</span>,0.0756601318]</span> . <span style="color:orange">A possible solution to the conditions is to have the scientists float above the surface on the planet. Another way, is to have a vehicle instead of a person hover over the surface. NASA is working on new approaches to study Venus. They make devices such as electronics made of silicon carbide and test it in a chamber that resembles the same conditions as Venus. When comparing systems that use mechanical parts than modern electronics, the mechanical parts an be made to where they are more resistant to the forces on Venus such as pressure and heat.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1153545172,<span style="color:white">0.8112778540000001</span>,0.0733676302]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Instead of looking at all the flaws in studying Venus, there are still some major components that can lead us to studying it</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.256807886,<span style="color:white">0.716493118</span>,0.0266989852]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Even though Venus has harsh conditions that humans are not able to survive on, there are still technological avdvances that could lead us to exploring or living on the planet. Most scientists are curious of new things even if they can not physically study it in which the, "Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." such as Venus. The conditions of Venus will not stop scientists or researchers from trying to gather more and more information of Venus. The study of Venus could be an oppertunity to a whole new world.
