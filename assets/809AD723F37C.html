<span style="color:orange">The "Face on Mars" was not created by aliens. NASA has literal proof of the Face. It may be on pictures, but the things they put in movies and magazines isn't real. They use that to get attention, but they didnt actually go into space and get the pictures. NASA took time to build those space technologies that are made to go into space and look for things like that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Hollywood movies and fiction magazines aren't true about the "Face on Mars."</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They say the "Face on Mars" was made by natural land forming. That is true</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">On Earth we have rocks formed naturally, or fossils were made using the imprint of dead animals and plants, but still formed naturally over time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Do not believe what movies and sometimes even the internet says. Who you should really believe is the people who actually saw the "Face on Mars" with the technology they have built to study it. You should listen to the team of scientist who know all about space and the planets. They study the galaxy inside and out and know way more about the "Face on Mars" and the planets then the movies and magazines do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
