<span style="color:orange">This all started 21 years ago. Here is how the face on Mars was discovered. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, taking pictures for possible landing sites for it's sister Viking 2 and it spotted a shadown of a likely human face. It was a great big head shaped face 2 miles apart from end to end. That is how this all started.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">How could aliens make such a thing? There is no way.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Some scientist believe that the face was an alien artifact, the photographing from Cydonia became a priorty for NASA when MGS showed up at the Red Planet in Sepmber. The face was not created by some things we like to call aliens that we don't even know if they exist or not, kind of like mermiads or unicorns.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There is to much evidence of how this face could of formed on it's own</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">It was so bi it would take aliens so long to even make this thing we say that looks like a face. Some people belive that the face is "bona fide", which means that that face is evidence that there was life on Mars at one point. Nobody has that big of a face for it to be an actual human face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I believe it is just a natual landform that just happened to look a lot like a human face</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">The face is exactly located 41 degrees North martian latitude where it was winter in April '98, a very cloudy time on the Red Planet. This investigation the scientist haas said has been very hard work to figure out exaclty what it is.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">I still belive with all the evidence we have it has to just be God's creation and it just apeared to look like a face, no aliens or anything like that because if you want to tell me that aliens did it you better be showing me that aliens even exist first.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
