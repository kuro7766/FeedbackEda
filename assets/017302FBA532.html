<span style="color:yellow">Would you change history? Some people think that there some things that were made by our past Presidents should be changed.

For instance, if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for whoever, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to that person. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.190208704</span>,0.725740648,0.0840506578]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The Electoral College is widely regarded as anachronism,a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be[overuled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the part's nominee; however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservaative reasons 1) Certainty of Outcome 2) Everyone's President 3) Swing States 4) Big States and 5)Avoid Run-Off Election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.349923228</span>,0.599018958,0.0510578376]</span>
