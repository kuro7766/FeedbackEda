NASA's possible solutions to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Vesusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms , a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of there way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface , temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be plentiful,and radiation would notexceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable enough for humans."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.381738824,<span style="color:white">0.5873319319999999</span>,0.0309292529]</span> </br></br>l
