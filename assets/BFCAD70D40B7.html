<span style="color:orange">I think the face on mars is a land form</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  becasue. <span style="color:orange">Only a few scientist thought it had something to do with aleins.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I tink it is a huge rock formation like said in the story.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">And I also think they said whatever they could just to have the chance for tax payers. To pay to help build the rocket or rover to get pictures of mars and study the surface. And I think it it was real it would be more detailed by maybe making hair eyebrow's or mustache. And standing up. And it is two miles lonf I dont think something would do that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">And there is landfroms in the united states like the snake river of Idaho but we never mad that and it looks like a snake. A lave dome in a mesa is the same hight as the face of marrs also. And I dont think it would have a bunch oh holes on its forehead if it was made because usually things are made good and if they can fly a space ship to mars they have to be pretty smart. Other wise they would not be able to build it. And I alsp thought it was fake cause the other mountain by it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So I physicaly think it would be inpossible to make soemthing that huge of a human.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">And I think there would be a giant hole around the face because were they needed the rock or whatever it is on mars to make the face. And its like a cloud kinda just because it looks like a bunny or dog dont mean someone made it look like one somethings just happen that way</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">So my final opinion on this is that it is fake and noone could make this unless you had thoulsands and thoulsands of people. And nasa said after they took pitures it was just a quensedence that it looked like a humans head. I could see why people say that cause I see eyes a nose and lips.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
