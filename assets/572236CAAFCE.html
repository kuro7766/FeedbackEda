</br></br><span style="color:yellow">People that have your same interests are different than people that you hang out in school.</br></br>You hang out with people in school because they have the personality that you enjoy to hang out with.</br></br>But, people with the your interests will understand you better and you will always have something to talk about.</br></br>The people in your group will talk about the same things that you do.</br></br>For example, a student wants to join the soccer team, and he doesn't know anyone.</br></br>The student can is always able to talk to his teammates about soccer because they are on the same team.</br></br>Then eventually, the student will no longer have to only talk about soccer because he has finally fit in to the rest of the

them apart.</br></br>It is important to get those types of relationships because if you ever need help to do something, then your team/group will have your back no matter what the problem is.</br></br>In school, you choose who your friends are, and once you have your group, nobody else is allowed in.</br></br>But when you join one a sports team, the student council, or the yearbook staff, then you set aside your school friends and you allow yourself to gain different friends.</br></br>People that you once thought were "weird", or "annoying," are now your friends because you
