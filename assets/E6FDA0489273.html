Dear Florida senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe that we should continue to use the electoral college to elect our presidents.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">using the electoral college is better and more benificial beacauese there is a certanty of outcome</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:white">everyones preident</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> , <span style="color:white">swing states,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">big states</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> , <span style="color:orange">and it aviods run off elections.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br>When you use the electoral vote instead of the popular votes the electoral vote exeeds the popular vote. <span style="color:orange">For example when president Obama ran his electoral votes equaled 61.7 percent, but his popular vote only equaled 51.3 percent. If your a fan of Obama then you should love the fact that we use electoral votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Electoral votes make it so that a president can only win the election if the have the trans-regional vote. <span style="color:orange">A trans-regional vote means that if a president was popular in, lets say the south, but not in the west and only the south voted for him then he/she could not be elected. A candidate must have a widely spread out amount of votes across the regions in order to be elected president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">There are such things as swing states. Swing states mean that the state is made up of people who are democratic and republican so the state has a mixed variety of voters. Candidates spend a lot of time campagning in these swing states to try and persuade the voters in the state into their favor.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  Swing states could be seen as tie breakers.</br></br>You may not think so, but <span style="color:orange">in electoral voting the size and population of a state matters.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The more people you have in a state the more senators and people you get in the house of representatives which means that the state gets more votes towards who gets elected. A state like Florida will have more votes then a place like Maine.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>In popular voting there is always a chance for there to be a tie but in electoral college they avoid ties by making it an uneven number so there will be no mix ups.</br></br><span style="color:orange">Electoral college is the way to go when it comes to voting for our presendent.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>From, Madi Bro
