Dear Principle,</br></br>Hi.</br></br><span style="color:orange">I am an eighth grader at your school.</br></br>And I am going to propose an opinion on whether or not the whole school should be required to do community service or not.</br></br>My answer will be supported with examples and other forms of evidence.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that you should not make everyone do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There are plenty of people who should do it and people who cannot do it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Many teens these days play sports and have families to attend to.</br></br>Although everyone SHOULD do it, doesn't mean they can do it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I, for example, can't because of baseball.</br></br>I play in two different leagues and I am trying out for the school team.</br></br>There are many others who are just like me and just can't even if they wanted to.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The people that do have time to do it are doing good for our society and so it does not mean that everyone must contribute.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also, if you think about it, a lot of teens, especially eighth graders, will not want to do it at all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Teens these days just aren't caring for our economy, society, etc.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">And if you do not listen to me and make everyone do it anyway, there will be protesters and you never know what they might do to get you to stop it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It is great if people want to do it but like i said before, not everyone wants to or they just cannot have the time to help out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Thank you for taking your time to read my (hopefully convincing) letter to you.</br></br>And that you please consider the possibilities of what might happen if you do go through with your plan.</br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>Eighth grade student,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
