The Electoral College is a process that was established in the constitution and it is a strategy that we use to elect out presidents. The citizens vote for the president, but so the the electors in the Electoral College. There are over five hundred members of the Electoral College, and if a canadate wants to win presidency, he/she has to gain 270 of the Electoral College's votes. Each person running has a set of their own electors</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.1001453024,0.397126044,<span style="color:white">0.5027286180000001</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Many people believe that this should not be used as a way to elect a president because in the past, the Electoral Collage made Gore loose the presidental election because although he had more popular votes than Goerge Bush, he has less electoral votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00398341066,0.1603842267999999,<span style="color:white">0.835632368</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some people argue that the Electoral College is trustworthy,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0238741941999999,<span style="color:white">0.4086122259999999</span>,0.567513608]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but how are my fellow Americans expected to trust a group of people who have betrayed us before?</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.0214936218,<span style="color:white">0.371205826</span>,0.6073005220000001]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Another reason why I dont think that we should keep the Electoral College is because so many people disagree with it</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.01123989152,0.317094464,<span style="color:white">0.6716656540000001</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Everyone has their own reason for not liking it, but sixty percent of American voters agree that we should not have it and we need to find a new system for electing presidents.
