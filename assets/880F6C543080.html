Dear principal ,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I believe all students should perform community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.02095162692,0.4411111200000001,<span style="color:white">0.53793724</span>]</span>  . <span style="color:white">Community service is a nice way to helps out . Helping out the community can get you far in life</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.01625859246</span>,0.364155682,0.6195857360000001]</span>  . <span style="color:yellow">People that don't help out don't get far in life . Life isn't just about what you want or need . Some people don't get anything they want because they are busy helping others . If people help out the community it would be much cleaner and safe for other children . If there was a park that was dirty and we had some older kids from school help clean it up , it would be a lot safer for those younger children</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01171897522,0.210597978,<span style="color:white">0.777683028</span>]</span>  .</br></br>When students from school learn how to help others and the community it will take them farther in life . <span style="color:yellow">You want every child to have a good future and if they learn earlier its much better . Say your child is in the 5th grade and there school is helping clean a beach . Well , later on in life they will be thankful they helped out because everyone wants our beaches nice and clean .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.02470994136,0.347017852,<span style="color:white">0.6282722040000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Some people are to lazy to help out . If we teach children to help out now they won't be lazy in the future</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.01309587156,0.32090755,<span style="color:white">0.665996568</span>]</span>  . <span style="color:yellow">Some people don't care about their community . That's why people say it takes up to much time because they are being lazy . Helping out the community should be something fun and it doesn't matter how much time it takes up . If its boring to you get a friend to come along with you and help out . The more help the better .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0634390444,0.420916058,<span style="color:white">0.51564491</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">In the future we don't want our community to be filled with trash and things laying everywhere . We want a nice place to live and grow old . We want a even better future for our children, but if no one helps out then it won't be nice . It will be dirty and unsafe . The more we clean up and help now the better our future will be . That's why I think community service should be required .</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0083259294999999,0.241903223,<span style="color:white">0.749770846</span>]</span> </br></br>Sincerely , STUDENT_NAME
