Back then itwasnt seeable but now it is due to these erosions. If their were alians that made the formation People would've already be talking about the alien sightings.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This is why the formation was not made by aliens. Also any aircrafts, small shacks, or airplains would be able to be seen in the picture due to the pixels in the camera. The camera would be able to see anything that goes on mars. All of the details that you see is just shadows from the rock That makes it look like it has eyes, a mouth, and a nose, and thats why the face is a natural land form and not made by alens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
