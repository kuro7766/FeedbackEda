What there was a tornado and it rips the school's telephone lines. Students with cell phones can call their guardians and alert them to come pick them up. Students with no cell phones will have to wait a while for new communication methods, imagine the look on their parents faces when they get to the school and make a scandal about why didn't their child call and tell them that they were okay. Think if there was somebody hurt badly and every second counted was a second closer to death. Now who would call if the power lines were down and the students don't have cell phones. Well you may say that maybe the whole administration had cell phones, maybe the teachers too.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1922460982,<span style="color:white">0.651852332</span>,0.1559015779999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">But some may get lost or broken, maybe they don't have a got telephone service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.169744684</span>,0.806340452,0.02391484862]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In a case of emergency you need as much communication ways as possible.
