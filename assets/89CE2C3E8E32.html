Adomatic cars will reduce the amount of accidents we have on the road by a lot. Accident are moslty caused by a driver, with adomatic cars, they will stop quicker than a person has time to react. But this plan will only work if everyone gets a smart car. Say if three out of four people get a smart car there will still be some normal cars left on the road, which with those cars an aciddent can be made. Self driving cars can avoid all the natural accident such as an animal running in the road or bad weather conditons. In addition to that many driver become sleepy or distracted when it come to driving, when self driving car are machines that will not do that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0948368332,<span style="color:white">0.818416204</span>,0.0867469588]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">With self drving cars there will be no need to get a license.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0502342378,<span style="color:white">0.902808802</span>,0.0469569778]</span>  <span style="color:white">Many teens struggle with passing the lenglthy test to get your license.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.348217702</span>,0.6468365100000001,0.00494580026]</span>  <span style="color:orange">As people age one of the most common things to get bad is eye sight</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.073403116,<span style="color:white">0.8901263</span>,0.0364705746]</span> . <span style="color:orange">This self driving cars elders can still do the things they need to do such as go to the store or visit family with have to relie on other people for tranportation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.219123752,<span style="color:white">0.773851494</span>,0.0070247657399999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Self driving cars are going to be the safest option on the roads today</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0469802952,<span style="color:white">0.918004546</span>,0.0350151556]</span> . <span style="color:orange">They aviod accidents, reduce the cost of normal veichals and are more efficent than normals cars.
