They should be turn off or it should be low. Some student would really like this idea about using phones in there free time. There some student who don't like to go to lunch or like to eat and by using there phone they have something to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2204074339999999,<span style="color:white">0.776190786</span>,0.00340177462]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The teacher get mad when there standing up by having there phone i don't think they will be.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.265517212</span>,0.7323607000000001,0.00212209688]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Most kids use there phone in school when the teacher don't look so its better to have the rule about only in free time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2333426059999999,<span style="color:white">0.7647475</span>,0.00190989021]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">By having this rule i think it will make kids be better because if there not then they will not be ably to use there phones.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1029558365999999,<span style="color:white">0.892248526</span>,0.00479561394]</span>  <span style="color:orange">That what most kids like and want to be ably to use there phone in school. Not all kids have phones so to make it far for everyone the rule should be phones and ipods only in there free time .Think this would work good as a rule but we need to try it first. In high school you can use it so why not middle school. Kids should start see how it work with the phones in high school. So they can have in idea about it. But not everyone is going to think how i do but i think we should try it for a week or two to see if it works. But think that policy number one is a good one and a good idea.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.3918024919999999,<span style="color:white">0.6036708199999999</span>,0.0045266920599999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">We never now if we don't try. We should try if it work we keep it if it doesn't then we just say it didn't. But we can say at least we tried. For some student it will work good but for some it wont. Some will have hard time with it but other wont. Most student do there homework when there testing and do good in there class. Maybe is not a bad idea doing this new rule about the cell phones. we should all look at this there some good things about having this rule and yes there some bad ones too. But i think this would work as a good rule for the school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.2284772599999999,<span style="color:white">0.76543674</span>,0.00608600652]</span>
