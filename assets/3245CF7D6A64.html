<span style="color:orange">Aliens, is this a realistic argument? On the serface of mars there is somthing impiticular. It's somthing that looks like a face. NASA decided that this would be a good way to get peoples attention. Now we are faced with the argument, could it have been aliens?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Spotted by the</br></br>Viking 1, the impiticular face does in fact closley simular to a face. <span style="color:orange">the possibility of there being aleins is very unrealistic.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">the face could have just been another butte or mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The face could have just been a coincidence.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  But how could we know?

The picture may look like a face, but its more like mesa or butte. or will there be mystirious things like this again? Proving that it was not a coincedence. Mabey NASA will find other things on different planets, or mabey not</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
