In other words people think they don't have a voice in the election because their vote really doesn't matter the vote that really matters is the Eletroral vote. Due to this reason less and less people vote these days. About i half of eligible voters voted in 2012's election as you can see there is a drop in voters. Most voters these days are people who want to expreess a political preference instead of people who think a single vote may decide who will win the election.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2843397019999999,<span style="color:white">0.677733162</span>,0.0379271152]</span>  Also Sentor <span style="color:orange">im not the only one that wanted to gte rid of the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1820906,<span style="color:white">0.8003819739999999</span>,0.0175274332]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all wanted to get rid of the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.23537142,<span style="color:white">0.7499100080000001</span>,0.01471857186]</span> </br></br>Sincerly,</br></br>PROPER_NAME</br></br>P.S.</br></br>Sentor i hope you make the right choice.
