<span style="color:orange">In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author leaves the reader to infer that exploring Venus' surface is a good idea</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0653877834,<span style="color:white">0.498900212</span>,0.435711996]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">I believe that the author did very well supporting his claim</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.026509442,0.391760602,<span style="color:white">0.5817299680000001</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">In Paragraph 4, the author states, "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." If this is true, then could Venus become like Earth once again?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.02676832054,0.31398094,<span style="color:white">0.659250748</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I believe the author is trying to say that Venus is worth exploring to see if it is able to be like Earth once more</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0234534652,0.36458559,<span style="color:white">0.611960916</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">In Paragraph 6, the author suggests, "Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough misson to understand Venus would need to get up close and person despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges." I believe the author is correct in this statement</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0223149639,0.285730518,<span style="color:white">0.6919545300000001</span>]</span> <span style="color:yellow">. If we start looking at exploring Venus as a challenge instead of a risk, it could possibly give researchers more motivation to get out and explore.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00600060244,0.1948507948,<span style="color:white">0.799148592</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">In Paragraph 8, the author claims, "Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." The author brought up the word "challenge" again,</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0307772586,0.287195476,<span style="color:white">0.68202726</span>]</span>  and I believe that <span style="color:yellow">he really thinks the challenge is worth it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.02319654412,0.367268426,<span style="color:white">0.609535032</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I agree with him in this claim because if humans can explore Venus, I also believe we can go on to do bigger and better things with exploring our solar system</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0721382012,0.432642086,<span style="color:white">0.495219708</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">The author did a good job in making his claims and then proceeding to back them up with evidence and facts. Although he had some opinions, the article was overall well written and well put together. The author convinced me, as the reader, that exploring Venus is definitely worth a few more tries.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0085236039,0.2238249,<span style="color:white">0.7676514640000001</span>]</span>
