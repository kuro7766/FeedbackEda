Canidates will only focus on the areas that they know or have a strong chance of winning. Like the year 2000 campaign seventeen states did not see the Canidates such like Rhode Island, & South Carolina, so how do they think they feel not knowing the person running this country?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I strongly feel like you guys should really consider a change to the way we select our president</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> .</br></br>Sincerly,</br></br>PROPER_NAME</br></br>SCHOOL_NAME
