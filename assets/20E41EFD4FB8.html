<span style="color:orange">The author does a very good job of proving his point about the challanges of exploring Venus. He makes a few valid points and is very descriptive. I think he did a good job overall explaning his point.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0627079684,<span style="color:white">0.8270145020000002</span>,0.1102774912]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">He starts off by talking about how Venus is a very similar planet to ours</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.13153728</span>,0.8316044,0.0368583224]</span> . <span style="color:orange">He says hat the two planets are so similar that people call Venus the "sister planet to Earth". He also makes the point that Venus may have held life at some point. He states that "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth".</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.149681714,<span style="color:white">0.8191616079999999</span>,0.0311566746]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">His next topic was about how we have already sent space crafts over to Venus. All of them, however, were unmanned</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0924605554,<span style="color:white">0.839744692</span>,0.0677947472]</span> . <span style="color:orange">They were all unmanned because the pressure and heat of the planet would instantly kill the occupants inside the ship. Even without anyone in the ships, the spaceships were still crushed by the pressure of the planet. He states that "no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours". He then goes on to say that this is probably why no spaceships have touched the planet fr three decades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1470528162,<span style="color:white">0.8027001739999999</span>,0.0502470143]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">He goes on to talk about how NASA has been trying to come up with ideas on how to inhabit the planet with life. they came up with a few good ideas but the one that stood out to him the most was a bit interesting</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1864842099999999,<span style="color:white">0.7585843600000001</span>,0.0549314389999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">He says that NASA wanted to try and get a blimp like spaceshi to float 30 miles above Venus' surface. at ths spot it isnt too hot or too dangerous and is almost perfect for life. the heat, however, would still be a whopping 170 degrees fahrenheit and we would be stuck in a thick cloud in CO2. He also states that even if we lived there, we wouldnt be able to photograph or video the surface to study it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.220652194,<span style="color:white">0.7362923859999999</span>,0.0430554166]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Overall he made a lot of valid points. I think that he made his point very clear and proved that attempting to explore Venus would be a challange. With its harsh conditions and unbearable heat, there would be no fun in exploring the planet.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.056665411,<span style="color:white">0.8438931000000001</span>,0.0994415066]</span>
