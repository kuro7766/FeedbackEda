Principal</br></br><span style="color:yellow">This is my opinion of your future change in the school activities. I'm not in favor in this change, if the students are good players, the principal have to let they play at least they have a grade C average, but if the students don't have a good grade, like F or D, the principal have to tell they that they can't play anymore, till they make a good grade.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.1230277426,0.826070652,<span style="color:white">0.0509016446</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This change can do a good change</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.23146643,<span style="color:white">0.7643382780000001</span>,0.00419527694]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because the students that play a sport or if they are in the band, and if they care more in the activity that they play, maybe that can be distorting the student, that can be the reason of why they don't have good grades, so the students what the students have to study at the same with their sport or other activity, and be good with both</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.22908298,<span style="color:white">0.759000998</span>,0.0119160396]</span> <span style="color:orange">.
