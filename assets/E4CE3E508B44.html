Today, I will only cover a few, though. They are very good points.

From the picture provided in the article, I can clearly see that there is a face and a fce only. Absolutely no body found. In fact, there is not even a bump or anything proving this has no body and aliens would most likely have a body if they have a head/face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.205152758,<span style="color:white">0.745982648</span>,0.0488645718]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The second reason as to why this cannot be an alien is, if it was an alien NASA would have found more than one by now.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0800932295999999,<span style="color:white">0.838487548</span>,0.081419231]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This landform was first discovered in 1976. That is a long time ago. If this truely was an alien that once had life, there would most definetly be more than one. But, there is not. There is only one. This is another reason proving this is not aliens, but just a landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.137487988,<span style="color:white">0.8162217679999999</span>,0.0462902512]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The third an final reason why this is nothing more than a landform, not aliens, in it would have been identified by now.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.090546109,<span style="color:white">0.8326209840000001</span>,0.0768329294]</span>  <span style="color:orange">NASA would have came out and said it already. There is no way we can actually prove that is actually an alien. But, we have classified it as a landform. We even have other landforms on earth to compre it too. Many say it is equivalent to a butte or mesa(many things found in the American Mest). "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," Garvin says.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.079926644,<span style="color:white">0.8195293620000001</span>,0.100543981]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, this is not aliens. This is simply a landform. Even though it does look like a face we have supporting details that back up our argument. It is clearly not an alien. Everything needed to prove this is tight in this essay. I hope that now you have come to your senses and agree with me.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0316505116,<span style="color:white">0.7907873400000001</span>,0.177562136]</span>
