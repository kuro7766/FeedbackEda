Another advantage is the kids can meet new people and make new friends. If its something that they like to do it can boost their mood. They might also become better problem solvers. Those are advantages to the students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.106673084,<span style="color:white">0.87584871</span>,0.0174782152]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Second I will talk about the advantages to the teachers.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.204164014,<span style="color:white">0.7885146000000001</span>,0.00732140768]</span>  <span style="color:orange">First advantage to teachers is they get to teach about something that they love. They get to know more about the kids and what they like.

It is also less time for their kid to annoy them. It could also make them feel good that there kid is doing something other than being lazy. Last it could also teach the parents something new about the extra curricular activity. Those are the advantages for the parents of kids doing the activity.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2070689739999999,<span style="color:white">0.776335818</span>,0.01659521776]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Those are all my reasons why I think kids should do at least one extracurricular activity.
