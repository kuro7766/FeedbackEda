<span style="color:orange">In my opinion im against driverless cars</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">not everyone is a bad driver , some people woud like to drive there own cars without anybody help or maybe people are causios of what they are doing .</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Driverless cars could be a good help but then again not everybody needs one . Some might like the driverless car and soe might not because what if the car your in messes up and spins out of control or crashes into something or someone . Then the person in the car wouldnt know what to do or how to react , driverless cars could be a positive thing and a negative like if someone was in a hurry and they needed to fix there hair or clothes while driving the car would come in handy or like i said if the car spins out of control or something , i dont think most people would like the driverless car if you ask me</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  . <span style="color:orange">Driverless cars might even cause more accidents</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">not all cars work the same and one car might fail and cause a accident or someone getting hurt or even killed because of tecnology</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  . <span style="color:orange">i dont think all cars should be driverless some people might like to drive themselvs at there own pace and there own speed .</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
