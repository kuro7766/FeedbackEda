<span style="color:yellow">A world without an ozone. People walking place to place. No electricity. There is no fossil fuel. These are some potential, yet dramatic, long run effects of the growing car usage since the early 1950's.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Limiting this</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span>  could <span style="color:orange">cause a better environment,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">more nonrenuable energy,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">safer environments.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">This new idea of limited car usage could improve our environment.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The ozone layer is being depleted and many believe it is due to the fossil fuels being burned by cars, trains, planes, and many other types of things. If everyone did not use their car for just a few days a month, then imagine how great the atmosphere would turn out. Some people such as Heidrun Walter, a new member of a "carless" community says that, he is much happier this way.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>As many of you may know, <span style="color:orange">the nonrenuable energy source, also known as fossil fuels, is slowly but surely running out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  Like stated before, <span style="color:yellow">if we were to just not use vehicles a few days out of every month, then these recouces may slowly start to build back up.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  We definetly would not be using as much. There is a town in Germany that does not allow car parking on the street and the usage of a vehicle is very limited. It is said that there is only the occasional distant motor sound. Imagine how much money they spend on gas. That was sarcasm.</br></br>Finally, <span style="color:yellow">we all know how worried everyone is about getting in a car accident, or being hit by a car, or getting 'T-boned."</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Imagine being able to walk knowing in peace that there would be no accidents. Children would be able to roam the streets. The town wouldn't be as spaced out because things have to be within walking distance. IT would all be apart of something called "smart planning."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">It would be wonderful not having to worry about danger or ozone being depleted. Knowing that a energy souce would always be around would be nice too. Everyone could agree that this is a glorious idea and the turn of a new leaf, the start of a new world. A more safe and stable world. So keep them in the garage and grab that bike you bought three years ago. Start peddling.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective]</span>
