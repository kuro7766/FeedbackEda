<span style="color:orange">In 1976 something very strange was found by the Viking 1 spacecraft. It appeared to be a face on the surface of the planet Mars. With this discovery NASA scientists took further investigations into what this picture could actually be. The scientists looked at the picture and determined that it was not a face only a mesa that looked like a face because shadows were casted onto it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0269978778,<span style="color:white">0.7360038799999999</span>,0.2369982612]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">NASA realeased this picture to the public saying that this was not a face on Mars only a mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0419969022,<span style="color:white">0.88128516</span>,0.07671794]</span>  <span style="color:white">This attracted the publics attention and it became a huge pop icon that appeared in books,magazinse,radio talk shows,and even in grocery store isles for Twenty-Five years.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.489744764</span>,0.501350948,0.00890428476]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Many conspiracy theorists thought that this could actually be evidence of life on Mars</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.1853403188,<span style="color:white">0.7983885000000001</span>,0.0162712073]</span> ,<span style="color:orange">But if this was true why would NASA not realease it to get a huge government grant to try and develope a way to send people to Mars to explore.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.362759662,<span style="color:white">0.6222321980000001</span>,0.015008173]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">On April 5,1998 Eightteen years after the Viking 1 and 2 were shut down the Mars Orbiter Camera came into orbit range of Mars and started taking pictures.
