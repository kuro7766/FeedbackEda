<span style="color:orange">A better idea for you change is that the students should have a C in the first semester to participate in sports and other activities.

The students don't want to lose that privilege to be able to do any type of activity.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Therefore, you should change your idea. The students should have to have a C to participate in the first semester cause it wouldn't be fair for the students that have a C. Then in the second semester change the grade from a B to C so that the students can work hard to get a B. This idea will help kids get a better grade, to learn more, and to be a better student.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
