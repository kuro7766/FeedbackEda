Dear principle,</br></br><span style="color:orange">You should require all students to perform community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">because not only does it protect the environment it protects future generations and our community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">For example say people were not taking care of the environment and throwing their garbage and littering in our rivers and streams, which leads to our drink water it would then be contaminated and the contamination of the water wouldn't just effect humans it would effect plants and animals as well. Or say that we were not recycling, all of our garbage would do straight to landfill's which would once again put humans, plants and animals in danger. Or perhaps we were letting the oil from our cars run out into streams and driving our car to places that we could easily walk to or letting the carbon monoxide from our cars pollute the air leaving more of a chance for global warming to happen.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">All of this can be prevented if we just take thirty minutes out of our day and pick up loose trash in our neighborhood or park or just as simple as recycling plastics, papers, cardboards, glasses etc.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Also students want have to worry about taking time away from hanging out with their friends because their friends can do it with them and they would be getting more done in half of the time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">This plan will work if you put it into action and I strongly hope you take my request into recommendation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>A concerned student
