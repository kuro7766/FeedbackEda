Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I personally do not think that community service should be required by all students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.00789933324,0.2627110359999999,<span style="color:white">0.729389634</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Yes, community service is beneficial to the community, but students need to focus on one thing, and one thing only. School.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00477940512,0.14689481,<span style="color:white">0.8483257759999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I believe that community service can be an extracurricular activity outside of school, if anything.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0102541053,0.2321643,<span style="color:white">0.757581594</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">You see, I know how it's like to be a student, as do you, and I think we can both agree on how hectic situations can get throughout the year. Homework becomes burdensome at times, schoolwork becomes tedious. Your life is bifurcated between school and outside of school, leaving almost no room for anything else.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01228218062,0.1664645779999999,<span style="color:white">0.8212532319999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">If you were to make community service mandatory at school, how do you think that will unravel? For all you know, petitions could be made by my fellow classmates. I'm sure some of my peers agree with my point of view regarding this topic.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0499339986,0.345158398,<span style="color:white">0.604907604</span>]</span> </br></br>I genuinely hope for the best of this school, my intentions are not to be harmful. I want to set straight that I am not just an ignorant, lax, student who is too lazy to participate in community service. I assure you I am not. I take part in community service almost every week, as a matter of fact.</br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
