This means, if Venus is that closely connected and similar to Earth then we can learn and adapt.

They found that it could have been another Earth once. I know this because in the text it says, "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system...The planet suface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountins, and craters,"(paragraph 4). This means that by studying it no matter it's condition we can to learn about it and why Venus is in the condition it's in, maybe to even prevent it for Earth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.02555405366,<span style="color:white">0.290077132</span>,0.6843688099999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Lastly, the author supports their idea by telling us how we are going to uncover more information without loosing more.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0165245815999999,0.367677138,<span style="color:white">0.615798284</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">They explain that NASA has a theory that sending anything electronic to it will die off within hours, where as sending parts from the 1800's - 1940's won't. I know this becaues in the text it states that, "NASA is studying other approches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lested about three weeks...These devices were first envisiond in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during the war...but, these devices made calculations by using gears and levers without electricity...By comparison, systems that use mechanical pats can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"(paragraph 7).

First, by telling us that Venus is like our twin planet and learning what happened we could adapt. Secondly, by showing us that we are can prevent our own downfall. Lastly, the author tells us how NASA expects to pull this off.
