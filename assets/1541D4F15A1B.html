The process starts with the computer constructing 3-D model of faces. It also, models the 44 major muscles that have to move like humans. By using video imagery, the software tracks the facial movement to recognize the emotions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.269279962,<span style="color:white">0.7236786599999999</span>,0.0070413978]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Second, the effects it has on the school could be outstanding.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.106361156,<span style="color:white">0.8852233679999999</span>,0.00841545832]</span>  <span style="color:orange">What if the school computers could tell a student's emotions? The computer could recognize if the student is bored or confused. The computer could modify what the student is learning to something more effective.
