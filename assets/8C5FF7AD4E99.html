The second way to perform community service is that you can tutor kids for 2 hours a week. The third way you can perform community service is that you can do a job. The fourth way is to help make some stuff for the school. Those are my ways to you can do to help out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1930021472,<span style="color:white">0.687346684</span>,0.1196511709999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Those are my ways to perform community service. I don't think it should be hard community service. If it was hard community service the students couldn't not get the work done. That is why I think students should be required to perform community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.2857272346,<span style="color:white">0.6686348320000001</span>,0.04563792612]</span> </br></br>serenely, STUDENT_NAME
