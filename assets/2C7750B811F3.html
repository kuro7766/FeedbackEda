Dear Mr. Principal,</br></br>My name is STUDENT_NAME. <span style="color:yellow">I think you should make the community service an elective for the 8 grade students</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">you can give them a high school credit and for the 7th grade you can just give them a good grade.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Other thing that you can do is to tell the people that want to help to came in the afternoon then tell them to tell their friends to came that you will give them an extra grade.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">You can make an enouncement with their parents telling the parents about the community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I know that the parents will tell them to do it because hey can make every thing they want in the week end. You can send a letter but not giving it to the students send an email or something like that but never give ti to the student because they will trough it in the trash.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">You can make a field trip to an elementary school or to a hospital and you can help the people first then tell them too. For the students that wants to be a teacher they will be happy if you take them to an elementary school and for the students that want to be a doctor they will be happy helping in the hospital.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There are too much different way to tell the to help the community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  Other thing that you can do is to call a person that helps the community to give them an speech or something like that.</br></br>Sincerely: STUDENT_NAME
