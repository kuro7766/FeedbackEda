Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br>I heard that you are planning to change the policy of sports, that you cant play unless you have a B average. <span style="color:orange">First i want to say that i agree and disagree with your decision.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I agree because students shouldn't get lower than a B but also a C average.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I disagree because students should have sports if their average is a C...</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">that C don't mean they are flunking it means that they are in average to play sports, because the GPA you should have to play sports is a 2.5 or above.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think you should let the students who have a C average play because when they have something to keep them entertain they will bring their grades up because they would want to stay in the sport they in.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I kind of agree with you because if you let somebody with a C average in a sport they wouldn't try their best to get it up because they are going to think "oh they let me in with a C average that means i can keep it that way."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">You just have to come up with some agreements you can come up with and share them with the students and see if they agree with you, and they disagree with you than just don't let them in the sport they sign up for.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  This are all of my suggestions to you... I hope you agree with me and i also hope you change you mind on the decision you have made.</br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME;]
