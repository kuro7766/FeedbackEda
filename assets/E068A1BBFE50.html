Then we wonder why people don't vote; it's mostly because they know which candidate is going to win that state. With popular vote , nobody knows who will win the presidency because all 50 states have equal representation. No one state will be greater than the other.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2676959339999999,<span style="color:white">0.606217962</span>,0.1260860992]</span> </br></br>According to paragraph 9  <span style="color:orange">"A Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after AL Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election,"</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.136481324,<span style="color:white">0.7960969400000001</span>,0.0674217312]</span>  this proves that <span style="color:orange">people are already thinking about having the direct election rather than the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.15731949,<span style="color:white">0.774698716</span>,0.0679817764]</span> </br></br>Sincerely, PROPER_NAME
