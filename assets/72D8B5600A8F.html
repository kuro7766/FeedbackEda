Dear TEACHER_NAME</br></br>HEY IM SORRY..!!!!!!!!!!! but <span style="color:orange">i don't agree with having a high grade ''B'' to be able to play sports, because many people like playing sports like me and well i don't think its far.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Well yeah it might help them pass there classes but still.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">for some people its really hard and well what's wrong with a ''C'' its still passing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I also think that if you want them to have a ''B'' to be passing i don't think you'll have any people playing for your school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">I don't know what to tell you i just know that's not a cool thing to us we love playing sports and love joining into clubs but if that's going to be your new rule well that's kinda not cool</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> <span style="color:orange">. But you know what principal at the same time you have a point because if we really care about our grades and about playing sports i think that's a okay thing to do because it would really help some people and we will be improving a lot well them after sports are over some people might have really grades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  BUT HEY!!!!!!! since its hard for me to keep my grades up i say you shouldn't add that rule. <span style="color:orange">Think about the people that have really hard trouble(like me) and they love playing sports but they just cant play because its really hard for them to keep there grades up, well to a ''B''</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . Well Mrs. this is what i think and well like you see i really don't like the idea so i would not be a good rule to have in this school. Well have a nice day and i just wanted to let you know that.</br></br>- STUDENT_NAME <3
