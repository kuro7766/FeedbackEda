They can be forgiven, or almost forgotten, but they will always be tucked in your mind or somebody else's mind. Sometimes people aren't very cautious about what they say or do, and they don't think about how others might get affected by their actions. Asking multiple people for advice is greatly rewarding because it gives you a sense of many opinions and feelings on a certain subject. Having good and varying advice can help stop you from doing something you might regret later on. Instead of jumping to conclusions and caving in to your impulse, you should ask as many people as you can for advice. That way, you can have time to think about what to do in a bad situation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01657993438,0.205773036,<span style="color:white">0.7776470439999998</span>]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, <span style="color:orange">knowing and asking for multiple opinions is the best way to make your choices in life.
