<span style="color:orange">Many schools incorporate summer learning into their students' curriculum to have them maintain knowledge gained throughout the school year. Although these projects are thought to be beneficial for students, the topics and activities given by teachers are often strenuous, and frankly, uninteresting to students, especially during their summer break.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.01043166144,<span style="color:white">0.264763174</span>,0.7248051600000001]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Summer projects assigned to kids should be allowed to be student designed</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0423247452,<span style="color:white">0.613530256</span>,0.344144984]</span>  <span style="color:orange">to fit the student's interests</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.014501669,<span style="color:white">0.414904756</span>,0.5705935679999999]</span> , <span style="color:orange">keep the child engaged</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.01256504866,<span style="color:white">0.401296838</span>,0.586138116]</span> , and <span style="color:orange">to promote responsibility when constructing a project.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.01339122024,<span style="color:white">0.38499879</span>,0.601609992]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">As a child grows, so do their interests and beliefs</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.195427489,<span style="color:white">0.6569229480000001</span>,0.1476495614]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Allowing student designed projects means letting them take control and organizing their own thoughts in which they see fit.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.00861061584,<span style="color:white">0.317211632</span>,0.674177762]</span>  By letting kids create a project based on their interests, it enables them to stay engaged on what they are working on, and to be able to put in their best effort and ideas into their assignment.

It's also important to give students a chance to be creative with their own guidelines and requirements, something that is restricted when a rubric designed to a teacher's expectations is given. Students would simply thrive more if handed an assignment they could create and build on their own.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.00489392,<span style="color:white">0.171603635</span>,0.823502418]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, <span style="color:yellow">schools should begin leaning more towards student designed summer assignments because of the immense freedom that is given and the responsibility that is required of students to create their own projects. It is important that from a young age, kids are able to write, discuss, and learn more about topics they are passionate about, and it is even more important that we do not limit their creativity because of the idea that projects should be teacher designed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.00359715648,0.197111868,<span style="color:white">0.7992909939999999</span>]</span>
