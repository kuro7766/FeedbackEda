<span style="color:orange">The Electorial Collage is the establishment of letting congress vote on whom the president should be with the addition of who the individuals of America elected. Though the Electorial College is not fair for individuals because, who they have elected are not really being accounted because congress takes vote determining who the next president would be.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The change from the Electorial College would be more favorable by the citzens in Florida even in the country because it gives more of a comfort knowing that the election is a 50/50.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In the state of Florida there are many retiries and elders who have moved from all over the country to join our warm weather, many of them have a lot of political views on the leader of our country so it would be best if they had the chioce and knowledge of knowing that their votes would be accounted for, they would not having to worry if it would be fair or not.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Though there are also some retiries that do not care at all about any of this mumbo jumbo and would rather just relax in the sun. Though if there wasn't election based on popularity then the elders would not have the benefits they would like such as more retirement funds, or better health care benefits.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Election by popularity should especially be approved in all states because each states should have the abitlity to vote for who they want instead of living in hope for who they they want to win</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Also the small states may be outruled by the votes from larger states such as California, Florida and Texas.
