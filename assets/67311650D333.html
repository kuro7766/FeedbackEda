The leading cause before that was drinking while driving . Statistically ,1 in 4 car crashes in the United States are caused by the use of cell phones while driving . 391,000 people were injured due to that in 2017 which doesn't even compare itself to the low number of 39,773 gun deaths in 2017 . Both of these are horrible situations to ever be in but a lot of people are ignorant to the toll driving while using your cell phone is . Though the numbers are generally associated with teenagers , these statistics could be any ones' life . Life is precious and the fact that it can be lost for some careless act is not ideal and should be stopped .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00419397782,0.1118024108,<span style="color:white">0.884003574</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Not could self phone use while driving be the cause of your own death , it can also be the cause of death of those around you as well</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0066437516199999,<span style="color:white">0.278715052</span>,0.714641194]</span>  . <span style="color:yellow">Some people view it was selfish that one person would risk sending a text knowing that it has the potential to kill an innocent person or peoples . A text can always wait when others' lives are on the line . Its an over-estimation of one's personal confidence when driving . Noone that texts and drives really thinks and analyzes the hard that they are doing or can do to all the people in the cars around them . In the cars are innocent mothers , fathers, children , veterans , teachers ect . It goes without saying that they don't deserve to die due to someone thinking that because they've texted and driven before , noone will die .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0177292059999999,0.255335524,<span style="color:white">0.726935274</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The actions that can be taken now to prevent so much fatalities currently is to lead by example .</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0155639197999999,<span style="color:white">0.411262978</span>,0.5731730899999999]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Even if at a red light , don't be a selfish person and respond to a text . If the temptation is too high , turn your phone off or put it away somewhere in your car . Make sure to be alert of your surroundings and stay focused while driving . And if one day it so happens that the person who is driving you happens to be texting and driving , speak out . If you would want to help the cause you can always speak out and promote safety in you community .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01508036264,0.2760861639999999,<span style="color:white">0.7088334620000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Too many people have lost their lives due to either their own decision to text and drive , or someone else's selfish decision . Many companies and state governments are currently trying to fix these horrible statistics and put and end to texting and driving . States have already passed laws to make is illegal to be using the phone while driving . Our current culture has become too dependent on technology and we must learn to resist the temptation and impulse . We must realize that life is too precious and too valuable to let it be taken away due to a text message . Once we and other people realize how deadly and dangerous texting and driving is , we can prevent the statistics to grow even more for future generations .</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.002194927306,0.1038631882,<span style="color:white">0.8939419259999999</span>]</span>
