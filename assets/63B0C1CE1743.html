Dear, state senator <span style="color:orange">we should keep the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">its better</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">its unique</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">Its better because the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for Presdident and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:white">The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The Electoral College is really a progress</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Its also better because you can help choose your your state's electors when you vote for President</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  becuse <span style="color:white">when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. They are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. Its better in alot of ways.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The Electoral College is unique in many ways</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:white">The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a Compromise between election of the President by a vote for President and Vice Preident, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the preident, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>
