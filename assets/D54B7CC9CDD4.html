<span style="color:orange">The planet Venus, is called Earth's "twin" when in reality they are only the same size. Venus is a dangerous planet, our spacecrafts haven't been able to land in three decades. The author of this article gives us evidence that scientists are still trying to find a way to land on its surface. Why? They know it's a dangerous misson, they know somebody could get hurt.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.25667215,<span style="color:white">0.7232823380000001</span>,0.02004550654]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Venus's thick atmosphere is made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, which blankets the whole planet. The average temperature is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience. Scientists should know that if they try and send a spacecraft full of men to Venus and land they are risking lives.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.188339304</span>,0.79800966,0.0136510452]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Scientists want to study the planet on how it used to be, they belive it used to be just like Earth and it could've supported living things.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.200235086,<span style="color:white">0.79149328</span>,0.0082716348]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The surface of the planet has similar feautures that resemble our valleys, moutains and craters.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.317194214,<span style="color:white">0.678446968</span>,0.0043588282399999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">NASA has one exciting idea for sending a spacecraft back but it would take time and money from the government.
