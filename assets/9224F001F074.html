These difference in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus because Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">Third, Venus is a thick atmosphere of alomst 97 percent cabon dioxide blankets.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Even more challenging are the clouds of ighly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In Conclusion, their is alot of ways to study and some of them are not the same as someoe who wrote it and studying Venus or Mars are very good to study in other planet it because Venus and Mar are the closet planet in Earth. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only becuase of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeovers.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
