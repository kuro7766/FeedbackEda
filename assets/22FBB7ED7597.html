His solution to survive this weather that is dangerous to us humans is to allow them to float above the fray. A "blimp-like" vehicle hovering 30 or so miles would help avoid the unfriendly ground conditions . At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0674268064,<span style="color:white">0.753457</span>,0.179116198]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So not easy conditions, but survivable enough for humans.
