Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I honestly think that student should be required to do community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Students have enough time out of the day to atleast help an elderly person across the street. I help my mom go around and pick up trash every Saturday.</br></br>You know if we picked up all the trash we throw down we could have a lot of garbage</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">People around the community could help by atleast caring about others because it would just brighten up everyone's day</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">Students should have to say good morning and have a big smile on their face when they walk in the classroom.</br></br>I encourage my friends to be happy with everyone because they might need that person one day</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Anyways if you really think about it we could make the world a better place, if we all stick together and help save the planet by doing the community services we are required</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I think that the students today are worried about sports, and not being able to help the community because of these jobs.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Helping the people in South Carolina is better than any sport or video game. Those things don't help our state become beautiful helping the community is.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It's sad when you see all that garbage when you go somewhere beautiful on vacation. It makes me not want to go anymore after that</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So think about what we can do to make our community a better place by making the students clean up.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">T he world isn't going to get better by sitting down and watching tv all day. Next time you see a student litter make them pick it up and give them a warning about our safety. I don't want to wake up one day and be surrounded by garbage.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Thank You</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
