<span style="color:yellow">Dear Senator of the state of Florida,</br></br>I belive there is something wrong with our voting system. Evidence has shown that our electoral system has shown some minor errors. In the election 2000 George W. Bush won because he had more electoral votes than his oppenenet Al Gore. But, Al Gore had more popular votes than Bush.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0543561882,0.8222180619999999,<span style="color:white">0.1234257602</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If this great country of ours is a democracy, shouldnt be the president decided by the people for the people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.116839227,<span style="color:white">0.8491014399999999</span>,0.0340593296]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college has been around for 100-200 years now.

IN the 1960's John F. Kennedy was running for president. In Lousiana race and segragation was still happening. The legislature of the state tried to change the electoral vote so all the pouplar votes would count against Kennedy. so the votes of the voter will have never counted.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.423333712,<span style="color:white">0.5554185119999999</span>,0.02124779648]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">But the system of working is also a good thin. the votes can be avergae easier</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.584783508</span>,0.4104687460000001,0.00474774526]</span> .
