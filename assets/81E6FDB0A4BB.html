<span style="color:yellow">What is the electoral college?  The electoral college is a process which consists of the selection of the electors, meeting where they vote for president, and the counting of the votes.  The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The electoral college should be diminished</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>  because <span style="color:yellow">it is an unfair direct election</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> , and <span style="color:yellow">the disaster factor.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">To begin, by keeping the electoral college we could avoid run off elections.  This would help our governmental system</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">because as noted by Richard A.

(Office of the Federal Register).  This means, voters have no control over whom controls the country.  That is outrageous that the lives of these people will be affected by someone they did not want in the overpowering decisions of their country. Writer Plumer states, "At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair too voters" as well as "The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational" (Plumer).  Both of these point go to show that the electoral college is lowering our hopes for the government.  The writer also notes, "candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states" (Plumer).  This proves that the electoral government thinks about their winning chances instead of our countries government.  Are we going to sit here and let them take advantage of their power that will lead us towards disaster?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">All in all, the electoral collage should be banished from the government.  Who wants our government to get weaker and more unfair to the citizens?  By taking away the electoral college our government would gain back its strength and become the hard- working government we know it can be!</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective]</span>
