<span style="color:yellow">Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break, but are unsure whether these tasks should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Psychologists have proven that in order for a person to actually remember information, that information needs to be repeatedly tested upon in order to remain significant in the brain. Summer break, as a huge gap in between learning periods, is massively disruptive to the cognitive process</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0030937728,0.1361997787999999,<span style="color:white">0.8607064299999999</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Summer projects given over the break period should be moderately designed by the students themselves</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.02598300214,0.501413938,<span style="color:white">0.4726030479999999</span>]</span> , because <span style="color:orange">it gives the student control over their individual situation</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.00412590184,<span style="color:white">0.26111898</span>,0.734755086]</span> , <span style="color:orange">it allows the student to express themselves creatively</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.00482731396,<span style="color:white">0.292711438</span>,0.70246128]</span> , and <span style="color:orange">it removes pressure from school teachers; all while preparing them for life after school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.00298048836,<span style="color:white">0.209864908</span>,0.787154614]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Students in school are constantly coddled, both by their parents and by the teachers in their learning environment.

Teenagers in high school spread rapidly after the school season has ended. Some travel, or get jobs, or go to summer camps; while others prefer to stay rooted where they are comfortably. Giving students that ability to decide for themselves how they are going to carry through with working around those activities is necessity. It allows them room to breathe. Putting the responsibility of caring for their own needs in students' hands gives them the much-needed abilities they will need for later in life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0014819421899999,0.0733826054,<span style="color:white">0.925135496</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Teenagers during the school year often don't get the opportunity to express themselves creatively and individually.

Difference in thought is an important concept that needs to be stressed to young people in society. No person is the same as any other.

Teachers especially, who work in an environment surrounded by teen drama and the potential spread of sickness, need time off to recover. Forcing them to plan and grade massive projects during their supposed "time off" is unfair to them. During the school year, teachers often have no time to waste to spend with their own children, because they are so focused on having to grade those two-hundred papers for school. Giving teachers time away from the stress of other peoples' children gives them time to set aside for themselves and for their kids.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0018632836,0.0713162249999999,<span style="color:white">0.926820486</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Some people may claim that giving students the ability to design their own project is not "giving" but "forcing". Students may need guidelines in order to work properly and receive a fair grade for their effort. Or worst case, they simply won't do the work.
