Dear, Principle</br></br><span style="color:orange">I do not think students should be required to perform community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Because students should only perform in any type of community service if they litter or damage any property.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">This way it will teach the students that they shouldn't litter and that it is bad, and damages a lot of our property and if they do it they will have to pay for what they have done and suffer a big punishment. For example if someone throws a drink bottle on the ground it is there responsibility and they should clean it up.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Many students think that littering is a fun thing to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Littering is a foul habit for a lot of people, most people don't realize how bad it damages our community and pollution.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Many elementary schools think that cleaning up litter is very important so they take the time to help our community when they haven't done anything.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  So <span style="color:white">i think whoever litters should take the punishment of performing this type of action, and clean up our community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
