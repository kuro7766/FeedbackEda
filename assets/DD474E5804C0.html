Physical education would not be a class since everything would be on devices which is a conflict, which is needed to graduate. In many short word students will be gaining so much weight that they'll not be able to do certain sports they want or walk to their destination.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.08358932,<span style="color:white">0.8868408779999999</span>,0.0295698242]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Typing online or video conferencing is not easy if the person on camera is shy and doesn't like video conferencing which can be very often.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0853921798,<span style="color:white">0.902194894</span>,0.012412925]</span>  <span style="color:white">Accessing to both subjects can not be trusted if the school will be monitoring every movement you take on your device.

Physical experience is not the same as typing online or video conference. Knowing that student's can succeed in different ways is not bad even so they will be expected to have any sort of education someday in the future. School is providing knowledge for those who pay attention to school and more. Believing you can do what you always dreamed of is a motivation that will help learn more about life and the way it works.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1079290192,<span style="color:white">0.86733222</span>,0.0247387472]</span>
