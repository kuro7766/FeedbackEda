<span style="color:yellow">About twenty-five years ago, something happened around Mars. NASA, snapped photos of the object. On Mars, there is a face printed on the plant. People think it was created by aliens. NASA said it was created on it's own. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. Those are common around Cydonia. A couple of days later NASA saw a nose, eyes, and a mouth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.081047862,0.8731936040000001,<span style="color:white">0.0457585306</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Everyone belived it to be a face of an alien, but NASA said it's just a face on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0860201662,<span style="color:white">0.896467944</span>,0.017511893]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The face on Mars has become a popular icon.
