Another one is that poeple might think things would go more worse if someone mad a change because of they way the votes are coming in and if you voting on a behalf of a friend and send the vote to the wrong person and the other person lost by 1 vote when you didn't mean to send that, they should have a computer system that you use that makes sure you really want to vote on that person</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.405495832,<span style="color:white">0.5894509880000001</span>,0.0050531809]</span> .</br></br>It is another major thing about voting that needs to be discuss. <span style="color:white">when all these thousands of people vote they votes should actually count not just have people vote and then the only votes that count is the people in some court room that have more business people come in to vote and only there's count</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.643608638</span>,0.35520194,0.00118939988]</span> .
