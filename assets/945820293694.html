In the article for example says a BMW has a "Traffic Jam Assistant" whitch means the car can handle driving funtions at speeds up to 25 mph. What if the car was to stop working and keep going and not being able to stop? what would happen ? Nothing good would. GM has developed driver's seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. What if you trust this vibrator and you wait till it vibrates to stop backing up and the vibrator fails and you hit something? that could be dangerous. You could back into a kid or person and run them over. You could also hit an object and damage your car.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.147604857,<span style="color:white">0.767915112</span>,0.0844800316]</span>  <span style="color:orange">That's why i am stating my opinion on why i am against the development of these cars.
