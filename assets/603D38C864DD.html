Dear OTHER_NAME</br></br><span style="color:orange">I deeply support the fact that community service does the world a lot of good.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I do some service on Saturday mornings. I go to the nursing home with a few friends and try to cheer up the tenants. Studies show that people who do community service are less likely to do something infatuated further down the road.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>But with every great thought there is something about it which makes it not so great. This invention is no exception. <span style="color:yellow">Some people are just to busy to devote their time to community service because they could be taking care of their children, or doing sport activities, they could be doing college work or even homework.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Middle school and high school students do not have a lot of time to waste they need to start planning for college, school years is a time to experiment with new activities. It is a wonderful thing to do (community service) but not everyone has the time. Adolescence is such a hard time for children anyway we shouldn't give them to much responsibility because we will just get disappointed .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There is different things we can do though. Instead of "making" people do community service. We could have a chart over a year and the child has to do so many hours of service can get credits for graduation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But not so much that they could fail all classes and still be able to graduate because they did so much community service.</br></br>If you are really going to take this seriously I would highly suggest asking the children if they would like to do this. If a lot of people are interested maybe make a sign-up sheet for them. Since so many kids are busy you shouldn't make them doing something likes this unless they are volunteering there spared time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>I would love to be apart of this group. Maybe a leader or whatever is okay with you, I would very much enjoy helping you out in any means necessary. <span style="color:white">Community service is such an amazing thing. It really shows how much America has grown.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Times has changed a lot. Fifty years ago kids didn't go to school because they had to help their parents out on the farm. Now we have computers, video games, cell phones. All these things that distract us from what is really important, helping people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">We should try this for a year and see if it could possibly catch on then start circulating our ideas throughout the States.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  This was such an amazing idea I would love to be apart of.</br></br>Please write back. I will be waiting for your response patiently. We could do amazing things with your ideas. I was so happy you agreed to a play date with our children. Little OTHER_NAME is so excited I think we should take them to a park, there is a new Ice Cream place down the road from my mansion if you would like to take them there please call me I hope you still have my business card from last week when you house burnt down. I'm so sorry to hear about that if you ever need anything please call me. I am planning on visiting your business tomorrow around 3pm I am very ecstatic about our new business deal I have an amazing feeling about your new found friendship.</br></br>Sincerely your true friend,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
