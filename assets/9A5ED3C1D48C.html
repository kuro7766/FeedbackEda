In the text it says that " Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface." And the weather impediments are like some of the things we have here like the earthquakes in certain parts of the worlds and the volcanoes too.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2837869,<span style="color:white">0.707826222</span>,0.0083868831]</span>  So in some ways its similar to earth but with more extreme dangers.</br></br><span style="color:orange">The author did a very good job at supporting how dangerous exploring Venus is but how it also is a very cool planet to explore.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.208415156,<span style="color:white">0.78686139</span>,0.0047234654]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The author also stated this in the aricle " Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expaned to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."
