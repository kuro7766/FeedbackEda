<span style="color:orange">The new technology called the Facial Action Coding Sytem would't be valuable computers to identity human emotions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">First,Dr Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to comunicate.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Dr. Huang think that it won't make a differences by the new techonlogy. Dr. Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness,surprise,anger,digust,fear,and sadness-and then associated each charachteristic movements of the facial muscles..Using video imagery,the new emotion recognition software these facial movements in a real face or Mona lisa. If a computer could identity then it should identy all 44 major muscles in the movement like humans.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Second,"the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"observes Dr. Huang."A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confued or bored"Dr. Huang predicts."Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructo.""Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communicaton,"notes Dr. Huang."So computers need to understand that,too."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Then,Your home PC can't hanlde the complex algotithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">But we can wrtie down some simple instruction that"encode"different emotion. In fact,these are the instructions for a face that looks happy. It;s all about those muscular action units. Humans could tell a friend is feeling simply by he look on her or hise face. Of course,most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that convy happy,worried.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Finally, A classroom of student could identify more then the new technology could do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Sometimes,human might smile from the outside but human could change their feeling.
