<span style="color:orange">Becoming a seagoing cowboy means that you would take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that are being shipped overseas to other countries that need to recover their animals from World War II. It may sound like a lot of work but is can be very rewarding.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  On my many trips as a seagoing cowboy, <span style="color:orange">I was able to spend a lot of my time with friends</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and was <span style="color:orange">able to do some sightseeing in other countries</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I was also able to learn a lot about animals just from taking care of them</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I hope that you choose to become a seagoing cowboy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br>One reason for becoming a seagoing cowboy would be that <span style="color:orange">you would learn a lot about animals</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">I was able to learn a lot of body language from the animals. I now know when an animal is nervous or angry. I can tell when a horse is calm and happy. Knowing animal body language may help you not get a broken bone from being kicked by an angry horse or cow. You will also learn how to take care of the animals. I already knew how to take care of some of the animals from working on my aunt's farm, but I learned how to care for animals a lot faster from doing it hundreds of times everyday.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Another reason that was fun about becoming a seagoing cowboy was that <span style="color:orange">I was able to spend a lot of time with my friends on the trip back to America.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">All of my friends and I loved playing sports, like volleyball and table-tennis, in the empty holds where we kept the animals.

I was able to tour an excavated castle in Crete. I took a gondala ride in Italy and saw the Panama Canal. I also learned a lot about culture. I learned how bad things can be in other countries after wars. It made me more aware of the people and their needs in other countries.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">I loved the opportunity to become a seagoing cowboy, even if it was for a short period of time. I was able to learn animal body language and more about how to take care of the animals. I was able to see many great things like the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. I also learned about culture in many other countries and some of the hardships of living there. The trips made me more aware of the hardships every person in other countries face every, single day of their lives.
