Dear,Mr Senator</br></br>My name is PROPER_NAME, and I am writing to you to say why <span style="color:orange">we should keep the elctoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  What do you think, should we keep the electoral college? wirte me back and tell me what you think. but any way these are my three reason on why we should keep the electoral college.</br></br>My first reason is on why <span style="color:orange">we should keep the electoral college is because, there is a reason on why it is there in the first place.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Im not that smart but im pretty sure the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they started the electoral college. it is there because it helps pick who is president and vice president. I mean sure we do help by voting but there job is to pick the best one, by compareing statistics.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>My  second reason for why <span style="color:orange">we should keep the electoral college is because the people arent always right.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  Yes i said that the people arent always right, <span style="color:orange">take for instance the George Bush we messed up big time by electing him, look what happened to the economy, but that is what we get by letting the peple pick. Im not saying that we dont know how to make a right descion but can we please let the professionals do what they do best.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>My third and final reason is that <span style="color:orange">they do elect fairly  the bigger thye state you have the mor represenatives you recive,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">states like California,texas,wyoming,ect which means the bigger the state the more people sre going to live in that stae which would also mean that you would have more represenatives.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  i know that <span style="color:orange">your saying how is that fair if just because you a bigger state you get more represenatives?</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  well as i said in the last sentace <span style="color:orange">it is because of population.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because of population to even out the votes you would have to have more represenatives.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Those were my top three reasons on why we should keep the electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>  I hop that you agree with my reasons on why we should keep the electoral college.</br></br>Yours truley</br></br>PROPER_NAME</br></br>(ps write me back and let me know your thoughts on why or why not we shold keep the electoral college
