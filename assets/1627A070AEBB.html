<span style="color:orange">Hello my name is Mr. Baker with NASA, and we are discussing the landform that looks like a face on mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This is a landform not an alien marking.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There are known to be little life of aliens.</br></br>In fact this landform looks a lot similiar to a natural landmark in Idaho.</br></br>But over the last eighteen years scientists at NASA has been studying this landmark for all of this time.</br></br>There is no more evidence that it was an alien.</br></br>Because there is not a body for this creature unless the planet covered it up and made the body into ashes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This landform is very unique.</br></br>It looks like a face but over the years the picture does not look the same.</br></br>Perhaps it was a alien or something extraordinary.</br></br>But over the caorse of time the landmark has built up to look like a face.</br></br>The pictures from 1998 look way different because of the technology of then and now.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If you look real closely to the pictures you can tell that over the time period that the landform turned from a bunch of scattered dust into a pile that looks like a face, but it is actually not.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Reaserchers say this could be an alien,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">but I belive not because not one person has found an alien that was alive.</br></br>Aliens have been a myth for quite some time now and no one has really ever seen one.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Mars is a landform that is made up of a bunch of different materials and minerals.</br></br>Over time there could have been some solar wind and some of the landform blew away and made it look like a face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">From what the photos show people is a face that looks like a human or some kind of life form, and in 1998 the photo shows that it looks like an egyptian pharaoh.</br></br>But over time the land mass has changed so if we waited even longer it will change over time.</br></br>And over the coarse of another decade or so it will be changed.</br></br>Or if the land mass was touched it might break up the loose materials and the landform will be different.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So at the NASA corperation they study the material and the evidence real close.</br></br>It might be proven to be a land mass or another source of life somewhere else.</br></br>But for all we know right now it is a landmark until someone has proof it is wrong information. So NASA will keep studying the information they have.</br></br>Also NASA is trying to develop more information about this landmark. But until then this is known to be a landmark.</br></br>So until then this meeting is pronounced over.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
