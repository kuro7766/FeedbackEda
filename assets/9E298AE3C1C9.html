In the passage it states that in certain situation the car will alert the driver when he or she needs to take control.

Then it goes into a even bigger situation if the accident is on the driver or on the manufacturing company. It really could go either way but why even take the risk in putting your life in the hands of a computer.</br></br><span style="color:orange">What if a police car or the ambulance is coming and the car doesn't pull over to the side of the road to let them have a clear passage to get where they need to go?
