Dear, Principle</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think students shouldn't have to perform community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">because students sometimes have issues at home were they cant stay after school for activities</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">One reason they might not be able to do community service is because they might have a love one that is sick at home and they have to be there for there aid. Second reason is because a student might have financial problems at home were they may have to take on a part time job after school to help around the household with payments. The final reason is that student there self may have health issues forbidding them from doing any community service. Those are the reasons why a student may not be able to do community work after school because of personal issues.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Also students shouldn't have to perform community service because they might have other activities, clubs, groups or sport related things happening after school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">One reason is they might be too busy after school everyday to do anything else on the side such as being on a sports team for the town or at school. Second reason is because they might be in a church group that meets everyday to sing or study. The final reason is because a student may just be busy doing regular things like watching a relative after school while their parent or guardian is at work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Now even though my opinion is no doesn't mean community service shouldn't be done it just shouldn't be forced on students to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
