<span style="color:orange">Many people believe that " the Face" on Mars is actually a alien of some sort or a human. I can truly convince you why it's not a alien, it's only a landform. I can see why people can believe its an actual face because it has the qualities of a face: eyes, mouth, and nose.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Here are my reasons why this is definetly a landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">First, there is no evidence of anyone going to Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Mars has a very harsh climate and no one would even dare go off to a terrible, deserted planet to just not come back.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Secondly, there is no history of anything in space involving aliens and their artifacts.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Many would say that the aliens didn't want us to knw they exist</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">but the article states it could have been a person going to Mars. Scientists would have contacted the world and said we have evidence or living organisms on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Yet many people would believe living organisms on Mars and I can agree with that if they have fantastic reasoning to their theory.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They might say that if someone went to Mars they coud have not brought back anything or they got stranded on Mars and that could have been their body. People may believe that anyone on Mars would not survive the deserted planet with harsh climate and they would surely die there. Some sort of creature may have made it and they would give us evidencce of life on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">You never really know if there may be some sort of living organim on Mars unless you study it closer. Either I may be correct and it just being a landscape made from a storm or I could be wrong and its a living organism. We will never know unless we do the research.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
