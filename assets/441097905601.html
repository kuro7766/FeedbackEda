Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I would like to tell you about how I think about doing community service. The reason I wanted to tell you about this is because I understand that some students would like to do community service and not others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">In my opinion I think there should be a reason why some of the students want to do community service and not others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If the students that want to do community service can do that. If there is only a small group of people than it would not be a good way to have the work done</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . Please consider this and if you don't like this than it will be fine to me. <span style="color:orange">My other reason is not everyone would like to pick up liter.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It might not be what students want to do during there free time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  I understand that your the principal of this school and not every principal would consider this opinion because you believe that everyone should do community service. <span style="color:orange">I all so understand that it is very important to do community service around the school and you can learn many things from doing community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">I also like to tell you that there should be a list of places that there going to do service at.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely ,</br></br>Your student at SCHOOL_NAME
