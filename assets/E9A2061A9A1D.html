The planets temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than then on our planet. The conditions are way more extreme then what we've encounter on Earth. In addition to the heat there's erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.190614006,<span style="color:white">0.79625996</span>,0.01312603186]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">We could be living on Venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.44109884</span>,0.55612075,0.00278039502]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Venus has the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.

A vehicle hovering 30 miles above the Venusian landscape. It would be like airplanes flying over storms, but in this case its a blimp-like vehicle flying over the 800 degree surface.
