Which is good that they have there own because then the votes would just be a landslide on the outcome of it. Then the citizens votes come in and thats when the votes start to seperate in total, because theres more citizens voting for the other runner than there are electors of those running presidents and vice presidents. Now every state has there own amount of electoral votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.516213698</span>,0.47590378,0.00788252626]</span> </br></br>Now there are some bad things about the electoral colleges, for instance <span style="color:orange">under this system you vote for the electors, who in turn vote for the president. And for instance you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for someone, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors that pledged to that person, then he would get all those electoral votes for the state of Texas.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.249535592,<span style="color:white">0.737146598</span>,0.01331782818]</span>  And <span style="color:orange">voters can't always control who there electors vote for but they can sometimes, if they know who there electors are voting for.

Canidates dont spend time in states thet know they dont have no chance of winning.

I think we should get rid of this system because its reallly bad towards voters, and it  would make voting have more freedom other than leaving your voting up to the electors,  instead of yourself.
