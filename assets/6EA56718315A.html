The planet woud be fun to study but almost imposible the temperatures are over 800 degrees fahrenheit that would be imposible for anything to survive on the planet that meaning humans. Venuses atmosphere is also way to dangerous for us to even breath in.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.4113576</span>,0.58335182,0.00529057758]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The planet is so attracting to NASA because the planet is related in shape in form they belive it could have had oceans and could have supported some form of life.

They are working on something that would make the spacecraftes last longer in these conditions so they could retrive samples. They have some projects in the works that have lasted 3 weeks in such conditions. the trip to venus with humans going could happen but i dont think it will anytime soon</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.466119224,<span style="color:white">0.530244622</span>,0.00363617091]</span> . <span style="color:white">It could be possible but we will have to wait to find out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.647670972</span>,0.351288932,0.001040125134]</span>
