Dear Principle,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe that schools should allow students to take their phone to school</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">but should only use them in case of an emergency.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">At lunch or in a free time the students should be talking to their friends that are on the phones contact list or to others who may not have a phone at all and not calling anyone, but their parents, for example if the student broke their ankle then the could call their parents and tell them the situation and not leave them in the dark.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In class students usually use phones even if they are not supposed to and will text the person on the far side of the room.</br></br>Some teachers should have the students turn their phone off and put them in a shelf, with a lock so nobody can steal or grab their phone.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Some students would disagree with this</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but just telling the students to turn the phone of is not enough,</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because if the teacher walks out of the room the student can turn it back on and continue texting their friends.</br></br>An exception could be if a calculator was gone or disappeared and as long as the don't text they should be allowed to use the phone for educational reasons only.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Phones are a major distraction at school and is one of the main reasons students get in trouble some teachers are ok if the phone is in a purse or hidden and actually goes off others not so much.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If your question is not answered then i will tell you that policy 1 with some changes is the best one.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
