Students would be more than happy to have the permission to use their cell phone and I also believe that they wouldn't take advantage of their permission to use cell phones, but that's just my opinion on this case, other student might think different than me, so that's why i think that our principle should really think about this opinion.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.2135454708,<span style="color:white">0.772129256</span>,0.0143252787999999]</span>
