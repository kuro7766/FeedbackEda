I think they should not make driverless cars because we don't need them when we can drive on our own.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Since it is computer what if hackers hijacked it? Or maybe it messed up because its computer made and the driver has no control?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There are many things that could possibly happen since its "computer driven".</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There was something on the news before about people hijacking cars and other things, think about how easy it could be to get control of a computer driven vehicle, it would probably be more easy. If they are gonna bring them I think they should add security or something, maybe do a whole bunch of tests with devices to make sure that it's safe. This vehicle doesn't just put the driver in danger, but it also can put other peoples life in danger. If a person crashed into another person they could die. I know for sure that when I get older and start driving, I probably wont get a driverless car if they come out because in my opinion I think that these sound pretty dangerous and I don't wanna get hurt or something to happen.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This actually probably could help people who are hurt/injured who can't drive get to places possibly</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">So I think maybe they could add them aslong as they make sure its as safe as possible.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
