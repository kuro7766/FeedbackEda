If they are gonna bring them I think they should add security or something, maybe do a whole bunch of tests with devices to make sure that it's safe. This vehicle doesn't just put the driver in danger, but it also can put other peoples life in danger. If a person crashed into another person they could die. I know for sure that when I get older and start driving, I probably wont get a driverless car if they come out because in my opinion I think that these sound pretty dangerous and I don't wanna get hurt or something to happen.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.279219514,<span style="color:white">0.696416278</span>,0.0243642172]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This actually probably could help people who are hurt/injured who can't drive get to places possibly</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.098708466,<span style="color:white">0.886677336</span>,0.0146142085999999]</span> . <span style="color:white">So I think maybe they could add them aslong as they make sure its as safe as possible.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.248208078</span>,0.7469737240000001,0.00481818242]</span>
