<span style="color:yellow">Venus is the second planet in the Milky Way solar system, that is so close yet so mysterious. Its conditions are unhabitable and unsafe for humans, making Earth seem safe despite some dangers it also has.

The author says NASA has an idea on how to send humans to study Venus, "...possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray" (Paragraph 5). The ship would hover above, avoiding the dangerous conditions by remaining away from it. Allowing the scientists to be close enough to study some elements of Venus, and to have more context on how to understand it more, without a human possibly dying. To further support this, the author states, "...<span style="color:yellow">hovering</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0068656616399999,0.279379896,<span style="color:white">0.713754434</span>]</span>  safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight..."

The author further supports how its worthy by stating, "...these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all" (Paragraph 7).

He uses well thought out support and evidence, to argue that Venus is actually a worthy pursuit even with the dangers it gives.

He uses facts, and not a lot of opinions to express his ideas and belief that Venus is a worthy pursuit. He colcudes his argument that humanity's travels on Earth and beyond should never even be limited by threats of dangers or doubts. Without that, knowledge will be expanded and fuel the innovation of the human world and beyond.
