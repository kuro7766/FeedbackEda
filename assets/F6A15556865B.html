As there developing physically and mentally, also middle school gets out early so there home before there parents. Some feel like there parents don't show the same love or don't care. So they turn to people who they think do. When people start making promises and make you feel good you want to be around them more. A gang is not the answer but most will turn to one. Gangs are telling young adults to do many things such as shoot up a rival gang, homicide. and drive bye. These can land you in prison for up to a life time.
