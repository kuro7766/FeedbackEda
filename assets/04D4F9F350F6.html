Maybe they work, they missed that class in the past, or they just want to take it online. Online classes use to be easier than regular classes that's why some people take them. I did not take because of that. I take it because I missed that classes. Take regular classes will always be the best way to learn a lot about some subject, because you will have your teacher explaining to you how to do some things and stuff. Classes online will always be a good option but not as much as regular classes are. People always say that classes online are good, but that they do not feel that learn enough.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.30154406,<span style="color:white">0.686003836</span>,0.01245209328]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion classes online could be good,but not that good.
