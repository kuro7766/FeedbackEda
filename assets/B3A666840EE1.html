But, how do we pick who gets to be president? It all comes down to the electoral college.

Why make all these citizens vote, when the outcome might not even follow along with these votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.309894704,<span style="color:white">0.51088351</span>,0.179221763]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There are two types of votes.
