<span style="color:orange">The Seagoing Cowboys program is fantastic because you get to do a lot of things.

When you get off the boat you have a reward. If you like to see stuff like Europe, Italy, China, Greece then you'll love it. If you don't believe me ask Luke he's the one whos been to all those places. He said that the boat trips were so unbelievable for a small town boy like him.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Also <span style="color:orange">you will get to help people outside of your community</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">Like bring them food, water, and animals. It all ways feels good to help people in your own way. But it really effects peoples lives in the way you can help them. And it really doesn't take much to help those people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>But don't worry <span style="color:orange">your not alone on this trip if you want company</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">You can make friends on the way like Luke did because after you give the animals to the people who need help there is room for things like Volleyball, Baseball, Table-tennis, Fencing, Boxing, Reading, and Whittling. These are all good things to pass the time after some hard work has been done.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So if you like to travel, help people, make friends and more then the Seagoing Cowboys program is for you and if noy maybe trying to recommend it to one of your friends who might like because I know Luke did.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
