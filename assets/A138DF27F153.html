Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I consider that policy 1 is above par because of numerous reasons.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Most students need their cell phone so their family and friends can contact them when needed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some kids need their phone for the internet, like if their doing some kind of project that involves research then they'll need it. Most kids need to call their parents after school to let them know where their going to be after school, you never know what could happen.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Policy 2 is not the best choice because a lot of children are stubborn and not allowing phones to be on campus is just going to make them want to bring them even more</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Some students are followers so if they see their friend bringing a cell phone to school then their eventually going to bring one too</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I suggest you go with policy number 2 unless you want to hear complaints from angry parents, choose believe.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
