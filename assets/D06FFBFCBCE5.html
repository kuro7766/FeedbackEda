Dear Florida State Senator,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I think we should change the voting method we have now to popular vote because everyone would have a say in getting the right person to become our most important man.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Many people would be very happy to vote who they want then hoping other people vote the same person as they do to get a electoral vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Many people in political carrers question why not many people vote in the United States Of America.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Maybe some people dont vote because of this topic maybe they hate they way the votes get counted</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">i agree people shouldnt have to count on other people to there vote to the president they want. I think its a great idea for states having everyone vote and the marjority goes to that president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">An electoral college is consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The electoral college requires a presidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Presidents count on mostly big states to vote for them. People in the big states like califorina should be able to choose based on marjority of the votes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Elections are held on Tuesday after the first Monday of November. The way voting is held is when you vote your acutally "help" chose your states electors other then choosing then person that you want. Also voting for canidates electors to choose them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college is unfair very outdated and irrational. Many people today preferr that the congress changes they way voting is held other then hoping people vote for the same people you want to be president (Quote) Abloish the electoral college! ~ Bob Dole.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
