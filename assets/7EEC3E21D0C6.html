I have a friend that lives in Colorado and we used to hang out all the time but ever since he moved we haven't talked that much, that is why i think cell phones should be aloud. You have a friend he/or she moves and you grow apart from one another. That's how you loose friends not being able to talk to them while you are in school. That is my statement on why i think phones should be aloud during school during extra time and between classes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.21888487,<span style="color:white">0.759749992</span>,0.0213651268]</span>  <span style="color:orange">My parents even think cell phones should be aloud during school, because they want to get in touch with us when they need to, to see what we are doing,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0584419036,<span style="color:white">0.928906438</span>,0.0126516473999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">ask us what we are going to do after school, tell them what time to pick us up all of this stuff is a reason or reasons for being able to use or cell phones during school</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2005711519999999,<span style="color:white">0.794969948</span>,0.00445889524]</span> . <span style="color:orange">But i understand that some parents and school principles are taking them out of school class rooms or even the whole campus,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.188790666,<span style="color:white">0.8060469619999999</span>,0.0051623823799999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">one parent was talking to my parents about the cell phone policy and they said the reason i don't want cell phones to be aloud is because before i got my child a cell phone he was making straight A's in all of his classes but now he is making B's and</br></br>C's in his classes my parents told them that they under stand their reason for not wanting the cell phones during classes.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.236002766,<span style="color:white">0.759275964</span>,0.00472128592]</span>  <span style="color:white">Their could be alot of arguments for the cell phone policy in schools.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.5315195920000001</span>,0.467112692,0.001367709472]</span>
