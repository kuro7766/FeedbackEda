Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">Garbage on the grass, gum on the sidewalk that's what we see on our normal routine to school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0193263909,0.455975954,<span style="color:white">0.5246976780000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The school should do community service on their community</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.0255968486,0.527906776,<span style="color:white">0.44649637</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because It will help the environment,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0197491408,<span style="color:white">0.5082520880000001</span>,0.4719987619999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">it will help the student to become more responsible,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0179122036,<span style="color:white">0.503200458</span>,0.478887368]</span>  <span style="color:orange">and because it will have a good affect to the community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.02356348234,<span style="color:white">0.4931288699999999</span>,0.4833076619999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Global warming is a immense topic to the whole entire world because it's affecting everybody from City to animal life. If we take this step in the school we would be reducing the amount of garbage in the streets which might affect everybody. We will be able to see cleaner streets, the school will even have a better image than it does right now. Now the grass will last longer and so will the trees. We would see the space we might have left from all that garbage it used to occupy, and if that space is free, we could add something that could come in handy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0437672222,0.30704395,<span style="color:white">0.649188812</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Every time, theirs a student that doesn't care and leave their garbage on the floor. If we open up this program we could make students more responsible to the school. If the students see the hard work some people take to clean the school environment they would appreciate the work they done and might not want to throw their garbage on the floor like they used to. They would see that since now its them that pick up the garbage and not other people they would be more responsible and throw it the garbage can.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.02185752002,0.2802835199999999,<span style="color:white">0.6978589820000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">If the program is open up the community would have a better image of itself. The trees and the grass would look healthier, the school would even have a better image too. Graffiti that used to cover up some buildings walls, would now look even better.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0638878631999999,0.543569272,<span style="color:white">0.39254285</span>]</span>
