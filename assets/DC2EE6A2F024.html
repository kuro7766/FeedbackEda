Dear, Principal</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe that students should have at least a grade C average to be able to participate in sports and other activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Having a C average isn't failing it just means they need more work to help them out in the subject.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  Now <span style="color:yellow">if they are not doing work they are goofing around in the classroom then yes they shouldn't be aloud, but if they are not goofing around and they are doing their work they just need some more help then they should be able to participate is these extra choricial activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  Now <span style="color:orange">those with D and F average of course they shouldn't be aloud to participate. Now how you can find out if the students are doing their work is ask the teachers how they are behaving and acting in the classroom.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">I hope you put my opinion in perspective and will give it some thought.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>  Thank you very much for letting us send you a letter for our opinions. <span style="color:orange">The ones who need more help maybe the teacher could send a packet or explain more to them so they can get better at it .</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
