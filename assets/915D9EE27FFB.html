<span style="color:orange">I think that this is pretty cool to be able to read for face experssions. Like you can tell if someones happy or mad by a computer just reading your face. It can tell because how your cheek bone and moves one way and they can tell your emotions. Its crazy too how fare we came to be able to have a computer be able to tell if your mad or sad or any emoetions you have.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.210158358,<span style="color:white">0.78665157</span>,0.00319007184]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So I think its a good idea to have to something that able to do something like this.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.2397807952,<span style="color:white">0.75812083</span>,0.00209837466]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think this is a cool thing that your able to do</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.2453133039999999,<span style="color:white">0.7531588979999999</span>,0.0015277742119999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">like how they knew Mona Lisas emetions.
