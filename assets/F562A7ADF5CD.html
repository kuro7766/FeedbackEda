The Electoral College</br></br>Dear Senator of the state,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I am a former citizen of the state writing to you about my regards of changing the electoral college system.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The electoral college should have it's own individual vote to the president. It is unfair that the vote of the people goes towards electors who then decides whom to elect the president</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . Also, <span style="color:orange">what happened the power of the people? The citizens of the state who vote for an elector does not have the control of who they elect which president that is elected.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I suggest that the votes of the people are sent to the electoral college, then the electors vote upon the two presidents. After that, the votes between the two presidents are seperate, while the one vote goes for the president of their chosen and the other vote goes towards the other president of their chosen. This process would make everything fair and the majority of the vote doesn't just counts as state.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Sincerely, consirened Citizen       Â
