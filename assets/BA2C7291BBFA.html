I want to help others and do something important. I want to have a good for my own good and others</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">I think that is important to help because we never know if we will need help later on</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">And also i think that is important to do good things for the community sense we live and are the community</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:yellow">My idea is to help reading to little kids or even clean the school. i would like to help on something productive and on something that benefits all</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">the other thing that i personally think that is a good idea is to give food and water to people that do not have it. we can all donate food and gallons of water and then cook it and go to places where they really need the food and give it to them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I think that when we give we get the double of that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>i know that what we do is going to be for the best of all. <span style="color:yellow">we can even go and buy cloth and give it to poor children that need it. i know that there is maybe more than 10 kids this really need cloth and food, i know because two years ago i went on vacation to Mexico and I was being really selfish. My dad took me to an orphanage and i got to see how the poor kids lived in that horrible place and I imagine how it wold be if i lived there.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">from that i experienced that you should not care only about your self but care and about others too. that is the reason that i am willing to help because i know how people need help and in many ways that is why i want to help. i know it may be a hard job but it is worth all the work. I know that it feels good</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective]</span>
