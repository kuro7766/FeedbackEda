This will make students strive harder in school but also in sports because they know that they are right on the edge of a C average that will also make the strive harder in whatever sport you may play.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1188248596,<span style="color:white">0.6774424480000001</span>,0.203732692]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">On the other hand their will be many mad students and parents because that student is not able to play the sport that he or she may love. and also the coaches may get mad too because one of his or her best plays may not be making the grades that he or she needs to make to play this sport.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.01787527776,0.394280164,<span style="color:white">0.5878445480000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">This would probably only happen for a couple of years or sport seasons but after awhile everything would be back to normal and it would be just like anything else in the world and people would begin to grow to the B average rule that the principle has.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Effective/0.1003517978,0.633806932,<span style="color:white">0.265841272</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">I think in the end that this would be a good thing because it would make students want to try harder in school if they really like a sport and wanted to bring their grade up to be able to play this sport. Then again i think every school should have to have this rule because it would be unfair to one team if the other team did not have the players they wanted because of this rule. I think you could take this rule and put it into school systems and see improvement all over the state then maybe all over the country. So yes i think that even though it would cause a lot of trouble it would be a good thing to raise grades all over the country.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.01504018986,0.40055841,<span style="color:white">0.584401412</span>]</span>
