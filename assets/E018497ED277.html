For instance, my friends being to attend classes and he studies online or video conferencing. Some question, he doesn't understand and he has no idea to do his work. So, he has low grade in his work.

For example, we need to research and find the information in internet. That's make us work for more time and sometime teachers gave them the homework but some students don't do it. Some students destitute responsibilities in their homework. They told teachers with many reason as they need to go work, so they forgot to do homework.
