Even if it doesn't help, studying and knowing good. Paragraph 5 says "Not easy conditions, survivable for humans."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The conditions of Venus are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. However, peering at Venus from a ship or orbitting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomsphere.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">In Paragraph 8, it states, "Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should expanded to meet the very deges of imagination and innovation."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>
