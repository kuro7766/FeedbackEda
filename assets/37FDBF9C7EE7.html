If teachers can use them let us so we our all equal, and we don't look down on each other. I agree There has to be rules but we also should be aloud freedom. If we couldn't have phones at school how are we supposed to call our parents to come and pick us up. Or if school gets canceled how are we supposed to call them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.558972662</span>,0.43811093,0.0029164319199999]</span>
