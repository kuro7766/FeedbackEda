Dear state senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I'm writing to you today regarding my concerns on our voting method for the president of the United States. Although we've been voting by the electoral college for how ever many years, I don't think it is the most efficient and fair way of voting. Our Chamber of Commerce, former vice president Richard Nixon and many more would have to agree with me when I say that</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">abolishing the electoral college could only be beneficial to us.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The electoral college system is unfair</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> , <span style="color:orange">confusing</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">forces people to compromise.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The electoral college is unfair, being that voters don't always control who their electors vote for, opposed to election by popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">One reason why America strives is the fact that we are a democracy, where every one gets a say and we are not ruled by a dictators or communist. The electoral college in no way follows our democratic system, the people are not voting for our president our electors are the ones voting for us.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Not only is the electoral college unfair but it is also <span style="color:orange">confusing</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">For new voters they may be confused by the eletoral college. New voters may wonder why can't I just vote for the candidate I most prefer. Think about it like this, in the electoral college the electors are the middle man. Why not cut the middle man out? And as a result make the voting system much simpler.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">People may agrue that the electoral college system stops a majority vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So let's say, you're a democrat living in the state of Texas with the electoral college system in place. You might as well not vote for an elector cause the majority of the people in texas are going to vote for the republican elector.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">On the other hand, there is the election by popular vote, gives everyone a say in whom they'd like to vote for.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">There is always the possibility of the disater factor.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>After sharing my concerns with you state senator, I hope you understand where I am coming from.</br></br>My deep regards,</br></br>PROPER_NAME
