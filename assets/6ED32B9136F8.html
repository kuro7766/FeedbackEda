Seeing people and helping them feels great too not because you get apprecation from them, but since you get to know you did good for the world. Just keep that in mind.</br></br><span style="color:orange">It is a dangerous job though. "One rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as I shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped my slide, keeping me from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. I was happy to be alive. But I couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs." paragraph 7. That shows Seagiong is a dangerous job and it's very serious trying not to get hurt.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.1370830952,<span style="color:white">0.7421861860000001</span>,0.1207307074]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In the process we do have a little fun when we aren't doing much.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1331182169999999,<span style="color:white">0.822286714</span>,0.0445950722]</span>  <span style="color:orange">"I found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys and I played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed." paragraph 8. That was some fun on board we do to pass time. Since we were around the world we could go cite seeing and things like that away from the ship. These trips introduced this small town boy to the world.</br></br>The world is a wonderful place to see. Like I said off board we'd go cite seeing. "Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing Acropolis in Greece was special." paragraph 5. Seeing the world is speical and not most people can afford to do that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.234543976,<span style="color:white">0.690281068</span>,0.0751749904]</span> </br></br>Thoes are the reasons <span style="color:orange">you should join</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.172886563,<span style="color:white">0.8011384380000001</span>,0.0259749834]</span> . <span style="color:orange">When you do this it's adventurous, scary, fun, and amazing.
