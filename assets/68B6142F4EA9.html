The 44 muscles can tell how the human is feeling, by seeing how the person is moving. For example, when the person is moving really fast, it means that the person might be angry or aggressive. But when a person is moving slow, it means that the person is sad or depressed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.196350781,<span style="color:white">0.7854108139999999</span>,0.0182383936]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The author tells in the text, "We humans perform this same impressive calculation every day." But comparing a human mind to a computer is different. A human mind can think that the friend is feeling sad, but the computer can have more than just one idea of how the friend feels. The computer can have more than one idea by scanning the face of the person and calculating how the muscles of the face look</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.291803142,<span style="color:white">0.6978051359999999</span>,0.0103916959]</span> . <span style="color:orange">It may seem amazing to try to use the technology.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.40181386,<span style="color:white">0.5944155440000001</span>,0.0037705966599999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">From the picture of Mona Lisa, when you just look at it, many ideas would pop up in your head from trying to guess how she's feeling and how she looks</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.469353802</span>,0.526109774,0.00453642444]</span> . <span style="color:white">There would be multiple guesses on how her face looks.
