Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Have you ever thought on keeping the Electoral Vote or change it by popular vote for the president of the United States? I think you have. Well, we know what Electoral Vote is, the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">On my opinion the Electoral Vote should be changed in order for people to vote for the president they want.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">To begin with, the Electoral vote has a job to do. For example,if someone wants to run for president and the electoral vote has no voice in the selection there is a probability that the person doesn't get a change to talk to the people.

The founding father were part of the Constitution but also part of the Electoral Vote, which have been taken that amendment way too far.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, the Electoral Vote is been taking evrything to their power. They should be removed from electing presidents. They are going to be</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
