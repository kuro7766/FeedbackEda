<span style="color:orange">How safe would you feel if you there was a car driveing itself beside you?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I am against the use of driverless cars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  There are quite a few reasons why I am. These reasons are that <span style="color:orange">people will abuse this technolgy,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">it might not be the most reliable way to get around</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , and <span style="color:orange">people would be more likely to fall asleep at the wheel.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br>My first reason is that people will abuse this thecnolgy. <span style="color:orange">If you look at people now who text and drive and do other things that they arent soppoust to they will be more likely to do it in a driverless car thinking that the car will do everything for them. As it says in paragraph two in this article that the car would show a message when the person needed to take over the wheel but if they are texting or doing something else that they shouldent be doing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  Another is that they would be more likely to fall asleep <span style="color:white">witch is true because some people fall asleep while actually in controll of the car so taking away the abilty to controll the car would make it much easier of them to fall asleep.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  Its also not the most reliable way to get around <span style="color:orange">because what if the computer and sensors randomly short out or they mess up and send the car into a telephone pole, tree, ect.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that driverless cars are a bad idea because people will become more tired at the wheel, its not reliable, and people are going to do stuff that they shouldent and its gonna eighter cause them or someone else to get killed. This tecnolgy seems like a good idea to a lot of peopel im sure but its not a good idea because it will end up causeing a lot more deaths i think jsut because people wont pay attention or fall asleep or the car itself will find a way to crash. I think that driverkess cars would be a bad thing overall.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
