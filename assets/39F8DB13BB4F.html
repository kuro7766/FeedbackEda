As it says in paragraph two in this article that the car would show a message when the person needed to take over the wheel but if they are texting or doing something else that they shouldent be doing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1060946159999999,<span style="color:white">0.857242482</span>,0.0366628779999999]</span>  Another is that they would be more likely to fall asleep <span style="color:white">witch is true because some people fall asleep while actually in controll of the car so taking away the abilty to controll the car would make it much easier of them to fall asleep.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1609607139999999</span>,0.823265846,0.015773441]</span>  Its also not the most reliable way to get around <span style="color:orange">because what if the computer and sensors randomly short out or they mess up and send the car into a telephone pole, tree, ect.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1178080132,<span style="color:white">0.8634628799999999</span>,0.0187291197]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that driverless cars are a bad idea because people will become more tired at the wheel, its not reliable, and people are going to do stuff that they shouldent and its gonna eighter cause them or someone else to get killed. This tecnolgy seems like a good idea to a lot of peopel im sure but its not a good idea because it will end up causeing a lot more deaths i think jsut because people wont pay attention or fall asleep or the car itself will find a way to crash. I think that driverkess cars would be a bad thing overall.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0427080068,<span style="color:white">0.8396562679999999</span>,0.117635724]</span>
