I have seen many landmarks, such as the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, and I also have been through the Panama Canal on my way to China. Also it is a fun experience after the animals had to be unloaded, we all played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed. Also there would be table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and many more fun activities. Those were all some ways we had a fun experience during the program.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Our program also takes care of animals, but that can also be fun in many ways.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">One way is that it can keep you busy is when you are caring for the animals during crossing. They have to be fed and watered three times a day. What helped me prepare for hard work was when I would help on my Aunt Katie's farm as a boy. Also I would serve as a night watchmen, which meant I had to check on the animals every night. Once I almost died doing that job one rainy night. As you can see, taking care of animals can be hard but also fun here at Seagoing Cowboys program.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">My favorite part was traveling to many countries and all the beautiful sights.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I have gotten to see Europe and China during our journies. Cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. I have also toured an excavated castle in Crete, and have been on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, the city with streets of water. As you can see in the first paragraph, where it also shows I have been to many other places. In conlusion, you can see that traveling a one of the most fun parts of beingin the Seagoing Cowboys program.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Throughout the whole story, you can see that in the Seagoing Cowboys program, <span style="color:yellow">it is a fun experience,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span>  it helps animals, and you get to travel a whole lot. Those are some of the reasons that I would like others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.
