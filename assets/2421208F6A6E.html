dear principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that you should let the students bring there cell phones to school and let them use it during free and at lunch</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So you should use policy1 cause if you don't then their going to bring them so many times</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">It would be better like that. Because everyone will love using their phones with out having to sneak it even at lunch or in the morning.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">You really should do that but don't get angry if they forget to turn off their cell phones cause a lot of kids always forgets i do. And so does my friends</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Also i would use policy 2 cause no one would for get to turn off their cell phones</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">But they would be making explanation to have their phones</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  .</br></br><span style="color:white">So i would pick policy 1 but if their using it in class then i would take policy 2 to teach them a lesson. I wouldn't care if they got mad serve them right. So remember always be fair especially if it's about phones everyone again I'm going to say everyone loves their phones. I would take in to consideration that you would select policy 1</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Please pick policy 1 cause kids won't have to sneak phones to lunch in the morning or in class you would be doing all of us a favor. Also maybe they would pay more attention in class just maybe. It would be good for the school, for the district and for the students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
