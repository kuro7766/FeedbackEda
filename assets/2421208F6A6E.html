dear principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that you should let the students bring there cell phones to school and let them use it during free and at lunch</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.069991891,<span style="color:white">0.923514924</span>,0.0064932201999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So you should use policy1 cause if you don't then their going to bring them so many times</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.273880432,<span style="color:white">0.7233044759999999</span>,0.00281505874]</span> . <span style="color:orange">It would be better like that. Because everyone will love using their phones with out having to sneak it even at lunch or in the morning.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2281611568,<span style="color:white">0.768693316</span>,0.0031455251999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">You really should do that but don't get angry if they forget to turn off their cell phones cause a lot of kids always forgets i do. And so does my friends</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.479116328</span>,0.519226242,0.0016574267599999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Also i would use policy 2 cause no one would for get to turn off their cell phones</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.303576632,<span style="color:white">0.694027678</span>,0.00239567876]</span> . <span style="color:orange">But they would be making explanation to have their phones</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.443746052,<span style="color:white">0.554825236</span>,0.00142873735]</span>  .</br></br><span style="color:white">So i would pick policy 1 but if their using it in class then i would take policy 2 to teach them a lesson. I wouldn't care if they got mad serve them right. So remember always be fair especially if it's about phones everyone again I'm going to say everyone loves their phones. I would take in to consideration that you would select policy 1</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.7205685100000001</span>,0.278313356,0.001118161112]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Please pick policy 1 cause kids won't have to sneak phones to lunch in the morning or in class you would be doing all of us a favor. Also maybe they would pay more attention in class just maybe. It would be good for the school, for the district and for the students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0775539862,<span style="color:white">0.905511964</span>,0.0169340601999999]</span>
