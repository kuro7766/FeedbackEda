<span style="color:white">Scientists have been studying Venus for generations, wondering what could possibly be on a planet so close to ours. Now that we don't have to wonder anymore, NASA will try to take it one step higher. They want to be as close to Venus' ground as possible, without dying.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.16978734</span>,0.7382375320000001,0.0919751392]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Their plans are to use a blimp-like vehicle that will withstand the great amount of pressure and heat. It will fly thirty miles above the Venusian landscape, avoiding any ground conditions that would do them harm. It would still be 170 degrees F., but they would have an abundance of solar energy, and the radiation woud not exceed Earth levels.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0936666316,<span style="color:white">0.689209462</span>,0.2171238999999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">However, in order to learn all there is about Venus, you would have to go onto Venus.

Hovering over it would be useless. In paragraph six, it states, "... peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective." This states that by hovering on top of the planet, they can't learn anyting they don't already know.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.182820411,0.66152957,<span style="color:white">0.1556500288</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">My honest oppinion on this topic is that we should not be exploring Venus right now.

Trying to figure out its secrets now would just be a waste of time, money, and possibly lives. We shouldn't risk a human being just because this planet used to be like ours millions of years ago.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1637594379999999,<span style="color:white">0.762499426</span>,0.073741119]</span>
