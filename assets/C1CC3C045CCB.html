Dear Mr. Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I have heard of your potential decision to require community service from all students. (I am assuming that the students we are referring to are older than elementary school age.)</br></br>The details of the requirement have not yet been released to us yet,</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.1152741448,<span style="color:white">0.4948764379999999</span>,0.389849414]</span>  but <span style="color:orange">if the time you require is more than six hours a week, I oppose the decision to make it an obligation. I do not think that students should be made to do this.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.00879807776,<span style="color:white">0.2480157119999999</span>,0.74318622]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The choice to perform a service for the community is definitely one that should be encouraged, but should remain a choice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0108702538,<span style="color:white">0.276435722</span>,0.712694014]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The reason I think this is because many students have other responsibilities they must use the time to do. If you require them to do community service, their other responsibilities will have to be put on hold until they can get back to them. Some of their activities that they need the time to do may be personal, for example, visiting a sick relative. Others are for their education, like going to an internship (for high school aged students).</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.01494869946,<span style="color:white">0.2065902392</span>,0.77846105]</span>  <span style="color:white">Either way, this decision will affect how your students will have to manage their schedules after school hours.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1282057325999999</span>,0.678531158,0.1932631013999999]</span> </br></br>Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
