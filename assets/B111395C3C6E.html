<span style="color:orange">I think it would be bad to have community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I choose this reason because some kids never have time to do anything and making them do community service would just waist their time to have fun.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Plus what if some kids have after school activities and must go to them then they would get in trouble.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">That would cause a lot of trouble in the school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If kids just went to community service everyday they would be tired when they got done causing kids to be lazy in the future and end up being overweight.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Then they would end up not going to work and jobs wouldn't be getting done. If jobs didn't get done then we wouldn't have any new technology and we would slowly die out of the human race. No one wants that to happen do they?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If kids went to community service then their parents wouldn't really get to spend time</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  with them because <span style="color:orange">the kids would be working after school and they would be too tired when they got done working that they would go straight to sleep when they got home. they wouldn't be able to spend time at them on the weekend because the kids would want to have the time they could to play without having to go to work. Then the parents would be sad because they never have any time with their kids and the family would slowly fall apart. That's another reason why community service is bad.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">What I'm trying to say is that you should not tell students to do community service. You don't know what they have going on in their lives. They could be a professional basketball player.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
