They stress a lot in the passage about it being the hottest planet around and it isn't even the closest to the sun. This is a huge thing holding them back the author says and would melt almost all metal. The author supports this by saying that a submarine that goes very deep in the ocean wouldn't even survive on Venus. The author gives a lot of facts and things to support his claims.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.3564892119999999,<span style="color:white">0.631587824</span>,0.01192297926]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If the author has told a fact they have had soemthing to support it. The author says a lot about the things we can't do with Venus and has something to explain why with it. The author had a lot of facts and examples to help him support his and NASA's facts and ideas. I really like that the author will also give statistics because that is a huge way to support a fact or claim. Overall in this whole passage the author supports all ideas.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.45324371,<span style="color:white">0.5348754259999999</span>,0.0118808895]</span>
