<span style="color:orange">Im actually against the value of using technology to read students emotional expressions because thats would be a vialation of how you feel or like about something or someone. I think if you going use technology to calculate someones emotion they should aleast do it and keep it private.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Im going to be telling you a little bit about why using technology to read student emotion is bad.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">First of all i am against using this technology because, In the passage it says Faces dont lie and it can tell when someone is inmatating a fake smile and i dont really think that is true sometimes faces do lie.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">I honestly think that being able to read student emotion is awsome in all but its kinda personal. i dont think people want other people know about their emotions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">i also think that if this technology is used people will probably become addicted to it and it will probably start getting on people nerves</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">In the passage it states that when a student becomes bored and confused Dr. huang predicts that it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion use this technology will probably effect people thoughs and emotions. It will also effect how people feel towards one they care about it will cause a whole lot of misunstands confustion effection and unsterstanding. i think that using a computer technology to calculate someone emotion is bad for the enviroment and if we just ramdomly add technology in the world to know people emotions it will get crazy and out of hand. These are all the reasons why i am against use technology to know people's emotion.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
