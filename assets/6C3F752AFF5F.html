Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." Looking back at this, it is telling us all about the dangerd of even going to Venus. NASA has had previous missions but have failed because the spacecraft couldn't last a few hours after landing.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1733998448,<span style="color:white">0.7681427639999999</span>,0.0584573869999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Now obviously there has to be something on Venus or we wouldn't be going through all this trouble to get there.
