Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a very neat thing to do. <span style="color:orange">I think that everyone should join the Seagoing Cowboys program</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.080175176,<span style="color:white">0.8925881539999999</span>,0.0272366566]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">you get to travel over water.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0792491442,<span style="color:white">0.8945607360000001</span>,0.026190104]</span>  <span style="color:orange">By traveling over water you can see fun things like sea animals and you can also visit cool places.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.19802196,<span style="color:white">0.7946387699999999</span>,0.0073392593]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If you like animals or if you take care of animals then this is the thing for you</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0651538037999999,<span style="color:white">0.90930993</span>,0.025536275]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">you get to take care of animals so that way they can get to where they are going safely. Plus if you have never done it before, it would be a pretty cool experience because you also get to feed the animals on the boat ride and you get to give them something to drink.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.2051139712,<span style="color:white">0.77386042</span>,0.02102565014]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">This would also be a fun and creative program because you get to do cool thing like watch dolphins and fish and all of the other sea creatures swim.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.0954768759999999</span>,0.8595752079999999,0.0449479438]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The way that this would be a creative program is because you could make up names for the animals. In the text it says, "The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy." So in that sentence, it proves that being a seagoing cowboy was a fun experience.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.678135736,<span style="color:white">0.318316566</span>,0.00354767738]</span>
