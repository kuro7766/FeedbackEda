Some of them can be boring making people not want to do them. Then theres some people that love doing activitys like that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.142011962,<span style="color:white">0.84988394</span>,0.00810408508]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It shouldn't be up to the principal if they want to participate in them or not.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.1164974894,<span style="color:white">0.8759323199999999</span>,0.0075701859]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There is just some people that can't participate in things like sports</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1741868452,<span style="color:white">0.820006774</span>,0.00580636382]</span>  , <span style="color:orange">if doing extracurricular activitys could help peoples grades then i think the people that aren't interested in doing them would be more interested then.

I don't think trying it once would hurt to see if you like it or not! If our principal made us do this i feel like it should be once a mouth because other people have other things to do and are busy , and i feel like the students should be able to pick what activity they want to do or not. And the teachers should put it in as a grade if they participate or not.</br></br>End of teh story , i think theres no point in extracurricular activitys.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.249455932,<span style="color:white">0.738859854</span>,0.0116842269]</span>
