You may say that the landform is created by aliens and we're just hiding it from you, but you're sorely mistaken because this discovery would help NASA as a whole if we did reveal it. That's just one of many reasons that we aren't lying about it being a landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1083397949999999,<span style="color:white">0.6989830100000001</span>,0.192677174]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Another reason that we are completely sure it's a landform is because we can't spot any sign of life on the face</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0475194932,<span style="color:white">0.7884597</span>,0.16402078]</span> . <span style="color:orange">As we said "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size," "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.095750377,<span style="color:white">0.7419623399999999</span>,0.162287274]</span>  <span style="color:white">So even if you thought we were lying saying "Oh this image is a lie they have secret ones that actually show that there's life on Mars in their building,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.35186456</span>,0.624911024,0.0232244162]</span> " <span style="color:orange">you would have no clue that there's no reason for us to hide life being on Mars</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.306785718,<span style="color:white">0.671118548</span>,0.0220957204]</span> . <span style="color:orange">We wouldn't have anything bad happen to us because we discovered life on Mars we would get rewarded for discovering life on Mars so why would we hide it?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.240451176,<span style="color:white">0.71583685</span>,0.0437119638]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">And the last reason is that we have factual evidence and credibility to back up that there's no life on Mars</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.10239769,<span style="color:white">0.8033276600000001</span>,0.09427464]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">Like we said during this speech we said that "And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform." Later on we did it again in the speech "Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. "We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view," Said Garving. "Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution." "Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo." Now you may say that we never did that, but we have photographic evidence of that clear photo that lets you see everything on the face.
