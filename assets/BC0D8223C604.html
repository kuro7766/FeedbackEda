<span style="color:yellow">Mr. and Mrs. Smith get prepared for the elections, which is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. They're both really assured on who they are electing, Mr. Keen, the remarkable Republican canidate. Mr. Keen would most definitely operate in Mr. and Mrs. Smiths' favor, due to the fact that Keen offers a convinient medical insurance for they're family, opposes of abortion and is projecting sites for the unemployed individuals. Clearly, candidate Mr. Keen is a go for the Smiths'  family, but what if they're doomed of their vote not getting qualified due to the systems', such as the Electoral College?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.1534758218,0.5253460480000001,<span style="color:white">0.3211781368</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The Electoral College is a ominous process,</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0984617939999999,<span style="color:white">0.741985104</span>,0.1595531056]</span>  <span style="color:orange">due to the fact that voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.075008774,<span style="color:white">0.73039532</span>,0.1945958892]</span> , <span style="color:orange">disvalues ones' citizenship rights</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1053652354,<span style="color:white">0.733888494</span>,0.1607463142]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">it's going to influence the country of not voting.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1292228604,<span style="color:white">0.69558091</span>,0.1751962322]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Firstly, the Electoral College is a cynical process where not everyones' vote is taking account of.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0813388806,<span style="color:white">0.704076952</span>,0.2145841954]</span>  <span style="color:white">Imagine, voting in the upcoming election in vain knowing that organizations that only select the votes of one entire state, unconsious of the other millions individuals in the other surplus of the nation exist. The possibility of the one in fifty states choosing majorly one particular candidate, is highly risky for the goverment, and no one should permit putting in risk the goverment with this stubborn prefrence of electoral votes.

Due to the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing'' states. The pending thought, that ones' state might be chosen out of the many, is certainly doubtful. The Electoral College, can upbring wins in the popular votes but lost in the presidency, these democracies need to be abolished because it should be a doubt that the President and the opposed public, should be uncondemed of.

The opression against the Electoral College, has it's witty motives. As we all know, the most popular partys are the Republic and Democrat. If the Electoral College, only selects one state out of the entire nation, that allows one states, that carries one culture of people to form the regimen of the rules of that successful party. No goverment, should suit this fashion, because it isn't right in any shape or form.
