We have took many precautions into making sure that it isn't an alien artifact. For example, it's like the man on the moon. It just happened to be there naturally and created itself over time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">You are of course entitled to your own opinion,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">but that doesn't make it a fact.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion to this theory, it is not more than just a theory. We are not hiding anything from the world. Something like this I'm sure we'd be more than happy to share with the rest of the world in our amzing findings. We could be wrong, that is so. But, we're pretty positive it's just a landmass.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
