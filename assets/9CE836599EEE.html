The Electoral College is a process, not a place. It's process consists of the selection of the electors, a meeting of the electors where they vote for President & Vice President, & the counting of the votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 votes is required to elect the President. In the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Colubia is allocated 3 electors & treated like a state for purposesof the Electoral College. The word "state" also refers to the District of Columbia. Every candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. Presidential election is held every 4 years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you vote for President you help choose your state's electors because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Most states have a 'winner take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.817771686</span>,0.1694776559999999,0.01275063772]</span> </br></br>In source 2, they talk about why the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong. <span style="color:orange">Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.232013052,<span style="color:white">0.748996814</span>,0.018990113]</span>  over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. <span style="color:white">For instance, if you lived in Texas, & wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would be voting for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.
