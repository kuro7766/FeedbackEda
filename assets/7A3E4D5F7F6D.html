An extra curricular activity I would recommend to students with this problem is to stay after school and get help from a teacher.</br></br>Therefore after this session with your teacher you have completed your work and now some stress is gone.</br></br>With extra curricular activities students have the option of help and they can succeed by using this method.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0716991147999999,<span style="color:white">0.7120869400000001</span>,0.216213976]</span> </br></br>Extra curricular activities can also be really fun.</br></br><span style="color:orange">Sports is a great extra curricular activity that is fun. With sports you can play with your friends and have fun. I play on a sports team and it is really fun because a lot of my friends are on the team causing sports to be more enjoyable to me, but what if you don't like sports. There are many extracurricular activities that are also fun. What I recommend is that you find something your good at and join or make a extra curricular activity about it. Extra curricular activities can be really fun or boring but if you get something out of it, than it has some type of meaning.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.166827854,<span style="color:white">0.771952974</span>,0.0612191621999999]</span> </br></br>Life skills are an important need in life and extracurricular activities can help with that. <span style="color:orange">Some extra curricular activities that you can make or find that can help with life skills is Baking,Sewing, and speaking a different language there are places near you that can help you with life skills.</br></br>An example of this is my mom participates in a cooking class down the street from my house and my dad participates in a foreign language class so when he travels for work he'll know how to speak in a foreign language and understand what people are saying there.</br></br>Extra curricular activities are there to help you with life skills too.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.170726768,<span style="color:white">0.772349172</span>,0.0569240274]</span> </br></br>I completely agree with the principals assignment and I would recommend to a lot of people that participating in an extra curricular activity would be a good thing. <span style="color:orange">Extra curricular activities are fun,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1017527365999999,<span style="color:white">0.86130076</span>,0.0369464812]</span>  <span style="color:orange">stress coping,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0981101444,<span style="color:white">0.846849194</span>,0.0550406548]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">can improve life skills.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0756833723999999,<span style="color:white">0.8558278399999999</span>,0.0684888244]</span>  Extra curricular activities can make it easier to suite your personal needs and help you get work done.</br></br>Extra curricular activities can also be fun and interactive with other people.
