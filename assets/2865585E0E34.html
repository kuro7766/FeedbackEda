<span style="color:orange">I am writing a letter to my state senator in which i'm arguing if i'm in favor of keeping the Electoral College or Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United states</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I'm in favor of the election by popular vote for the president of the U.S.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college is unfair to voters. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">For instance if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to kerry, they would go to Congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Also its Unfair to the voters because of the winner-takes-all system. In each state candidates dont spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing"Â  states</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In defense "The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates, to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states."</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  Ok <span style="color:orange">but the winner-take-all system is still focusing on the ststes knowing that there going to vote for you, and notthe other states that possibly will or will not vote for you.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Another reason is that the Electoral college is just a disaster factor simple as that</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">In the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F.

So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not actually gone to Kennedy</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Also what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> ? <span style="color:yellow">It happened in Hawii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who presided over the senate validated only his opponents electors making sure to do so ' without establishing a precedent.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion the Electoral college is unfair, irrational, and just a hotmess.
