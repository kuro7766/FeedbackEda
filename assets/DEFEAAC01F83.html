<span style="color:orange">I think that it's a good idea,</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because <span style="color:orange">it will make the students work harder to improve their grades</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">will be a good way for the students to study more and to do better in school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If their grades are to low to do any sports then they need to at least a B to do sports and if they have lower then they will just have to try harder or do better next time. It might get more people to get better grades and maybe more students to join sports</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">but they might also not want to do sports because of their grades</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> , and <span style="color:orange">if they can't get better grades then they can't play</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Many students want to do sports and many don't, and some just don't care.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For the people that struggle with work and grades and all they get are C' s then they won't be able to do sports, and if you change the school's policy now they that might jeopardise other people that wanted to join sports from playing those sports and people that have worked their butt off to do these sports that now can't play because of their grades will mean that they did all that hard work for nothing, and that they will have to do something else that will suite them</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">So I don't know if it is such a great idea to change the policy and make it so you need at least a B</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">maybe people will like the idea of it and maybe they won't but sometimes people go through with things that they disagree on and sometimes they like it after they do it and succeed then they'll think differently about your policy and they might still dislike it</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So I would have to say that I agree and disagree with your new policy</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> . Thanks for your time and I hope things go well with the policy.</br></br>sincerely, a student at your school
