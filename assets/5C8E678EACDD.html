Dear Mr. Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that we should keep the electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0504110597999999,<span style="color:white">0.8212745800000001</span>,0.128314357]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It provides winner take all method</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0530642053999999,<span style="color:white">0.8363610080000001</span>,0.1105747854]</span> , <span style="color:orange">it avoids run-off elections</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0598807153999999,<span style="color:white">0.836918822</span>,0.103200471]</span> , <span style="color:orange">and there is a certainty of outcome</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0655097583999999,<span style="color:white">0.8378541480000001</span>,0.0966360972]</span> . <span style="color:orange">I feel that the electoral college is not anachorism because it belongs in the present to.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1070898414,<span style="color:white">0.80525391</span>,0.087656259]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">First of all the electoral college should stay because it provides a winner take all method.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.046105197,<span style="color:white">0.830848936</span>,0.1230458273999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The winner take all method is getting a swing state. A swing state is good to win because people in toss up states pay close attention to the election. They actually listenÂ  to the canidtes and what they are speking about. They are known to be the most thoughtful voters on average.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.20794889,<span style="color:white">0.7547891880000002</span>,0.0372619074]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Secondly the electoral college should stay because it avoids run off elections.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0540111734,<span style="color:white">0.8296735259999999</span>,0.1163153168]</span>  <span style="color:white">The electoral college makes sure that no canidate recieves a maajority of the votes cast</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.32103954</span>,0.6626340940000001,0.0163263572]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If no one wins a majority of the votes cast then it would add pressure to the election because it would greatly complicate the presidential election which is reduced by the electoral college</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.204202631,<span style="color:white">0.765675412</span>,0.0301219381999999]</span> . <span style="color:white">If it wasnt for the electoral college then half of the people like democrats of texas and republicans in california wouldnt vote because their votes dont count.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.207645544</span>,0.72950271,0.0628517612]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Third of all the electoral college should stay because it provides a certainty of outcome.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.063837283,<span style="color:white">0.823501974</span>,0.1126607536]</span>  <span style="color:white">A dispute over an outcome is possible but not certain that you would win.
