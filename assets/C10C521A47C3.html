<span style="color:white">In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," the author presents both the positive and the negative aspects of driverless cars. Therefore, the author never takes a side on the matter.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1911414189999999</span>,0.671162286,0.1376963064]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This response will side with the argument of being against driverless cars</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0756893462,<span style="color:white">0.7521063399999999</span>,0.1722043181999999]</span> .

Driverless cars would give these two groups of people an exscuse to commit these actions. They would no longer have to worry about the reproccutions of such crimes. Such as putting other's lives in danger or getting caught by the police.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1039524303999999,<span style="color:white">0.7556489820000001</span>,0.1403985886]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Automated cars would not benefit the economy in any way.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.06339169934,<span style="color:white">0.6851799059999999</span>,0.251428413]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In fact, the cars could worsen the already bad financial situation America faces now. This is because of the following quote from the article. "Originally, many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads." "These smart-road systems worked suprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical." These direct quotes further express to society that these automated cars require very new, very expensive roads.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1292738507999999,<span style="color:white">0.739071174</span>,0.1316549646]</span> </br></br>Lastly, <span style="color:orange">driverless cars put saftey features at risk compared to having an able-bodied human to do the functions instead</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.04566937554,<span style="color:white">0.6941665419999999</span>,0.260164107]</span> . <span style="color:orange">"Most driving laws focus on kepping drivers, passnegers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."
