They say that they can tell if it is a real smile or a fake one by your muscules. The muscles called orbicularis make croe's feet around your eyes, but then a fake smile, the mouth is streched sidesways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle called the risorius. Then is said that if an ad pops up and you are happy then the facial action coding system is going to think you like it then more and more are going to be poping up. Sense it said that it can tell eveything just by four face. The rusults won't be right. For people that wear makeup the facial action coding system is not going to get the right results. You might have a facial problem or something wrong with you muscles. That you wouldn'd be able to simle perfectly. Then it will give you wrong results</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.3720495260000001</span>,0.617721686,0.01022880734]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The fact that facial action coding system is basiclly thinking and telling you how to feel it doesn't really know what you really feel.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.134630529,<span style="color:white">0.8585951719999999</span>,0.00677429668]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I feel like sense the camera is always going to just be watching you to see what you are feeling that is creepy.
