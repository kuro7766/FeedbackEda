Dear, Senator of Florida</br></br><span style="color:orange">After reading this story/argument i think we should remove the Electoral college,</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  why? <span style="color:orange">Because i think we shoud be able to have the final vote, not the electoral voters.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It states in paragraph 15 that "it is the electors who elect the president, not the people." "when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors." (paragraph 15) the reason why is cause they vote on the more who has the responsibility on taking part as president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college has 538 electors and about 270 electoral vote are required to elect president. There is one member of the house in your state of representatives also 2 for your senate. But in the district of columbia therenis allocated 3 electors that are treated like a state. This election is held every four yearson the Tuesday after the first Monday of November. So when you vote, you dont vote for the whivh presidnt your actualy voting for the candidtes electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">"It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win national popular vote. But in the year 2000, Gore had more popular votes then Bush,and Bush had less fewer electoral votes. This yet has not happened very rarely, but it was the first time ever since 1888." That only happened cause the elctoral votes made it happen. some informstion i put up there is to inform you what they do and how many votes are required to elect president compared to the thousands of people voting for the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I say that the electoral college is unfair!</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  why? well there's resons. <span style="color:orange">The first is cause they lost the presidency the year 2000 with Gore and Bush</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">Second of all people who favored the seperation of race.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">We, people shoud be able to vote on the president to make our vote count! Not on just voting for the electors the elect the president. Let our votes be heard to the people not the just the elctoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
