Dear Principle,</br></br>I am a student at SCHOOL_NAME</br></br>and <span style="color:orange">I think we shouldn't get community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">maybe some people that thinks they are wasting there time should do it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Us people that do want to do it should not do all day community service like the others. Also don` t punish the other people bad. They are just not helpful enough or just don't want to do nothing at all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">The people who think cleaning are environment is good they are so right and some people should learn from them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Clean environment means more animals survive and healthy plants for everyone to enjoy. Some people just don't understand natures true beauty in life. All of them think its all electrical keep us alive will is not some of it maybe , but not all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So that's why we shouldn't get community service cause some people just don't understand about it. And just want to do fun stuff and play around with their friends, and play with all the electronic stuff.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
