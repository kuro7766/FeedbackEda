dear state senator</br></br><span style="color:orange">Over the years many people have complained that voting for a president of the united states is unfair. That they fell that someting should be done to change the voting system. In the articals given to me i have read some resons to keep it and to abolish it. In source one the electoral college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers astablished it in the constitution as a compromise between elections. For the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.248193756,<span style="color:white">0.70365474</span>,0.0481515042]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The electoral college consists of 538 electors but if a majority is 270 electoral votes.
