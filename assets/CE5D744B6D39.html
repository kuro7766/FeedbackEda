<span style="color:yellow">Making decisions can be difficult when people don't have the confidence that their thinking is the best choice. This is why, when making important decisions, one tends to seek multiple opinions from others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.01127566666,0.3019675999999999,<span style="color:white">0.6867567040000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Seeking multiple opinions help make a better choice</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.03078649928,<span style="color:white">0.518884512</span>,0.4503290079999999]</span>  because <span style="color:yellow">one can look in a different perspective</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00862861106,0.320692022,<span style="color:white">0.67067939</span>]</span>  and <span style="color:yellow">can consider the best options.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00720848236,0.300477002,<span style="color:white">0.6923144999999999</span>]</span> </br></br>Looking in a different perspective can help people make better choices for themselves. <span style="color:yellow">Specifically, this is because having a new perspective can provoke more options for people to choose from. Seeking more advice from people with different thoughts can lead to more choices that one can consider. This is helpful because there is a bigger chance to have ideas that would make better decisions than the other. Also, one can consider things in a new way that they haven't thought about. If people are stuck with the one point of perspective that they have, this would not lead to another way of thinking. However, listening to other people for advice may help people to consider things in a way that they have not yet thought about. Therefore, the new way of thinking can turn things around into an opposite route of the original. Another example is that someone can propose an option that is better than you. Never think that you have the best idea, because there is always another creative mind that can think in a different perspective. One should get advice from these type of people, but continue to seek other opinions that may be better than the last. It is always useful to ask multiple people for advice because everyone has a different perspective that they look through.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.001634981566,0.0409094059999999,<span style="color:white">0.957455616</span>]</span> </br></br>Other people's opinion can be the key to deciding on the best option. <span style="color:yellow">First, it is important to ask people for advice because one can get multiple useful suggestions. If you have a handful of ideas in your mind, then you can ask people for the best options and why they think that. This would help people to carefully consider the options with actual reasons that support their answer. Additionally, one can make improvements to their thoughts. By getting advice from people, one can figure out what they are lacking. By knowing what has to be revised, they can make improvements to their thinking. One would also be able to gain knowledge from people. It is possible that others know more information about the topic that is being considered. From gaining new information, this could also help figure out the options that would be better overall, when considering the new knowledge into the decision. When trying to find out the best option that is on the plate, it is helpful to ask others about their opinion.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00348669244,0.0690841428,<span style="color:white">0.927429158</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Considering the best option and looking into things with a new perspective can help people make better decisions.
