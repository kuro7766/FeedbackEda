For example a person uses a facial recognition for his phone,that's good because because can't nobody else can get into his device.</br></br>The thing about it is who was the person to come up with this idea I think its cool but there using up all this technology. I think that there is a reason for everything and I wonder what made that that person come up with that idea.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.553330792,<span style="color:white">0.445432688</span>,0.001236514396]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Another reason why I think this is a cool idea is because it knows who you are even when you have on different face expression</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.199598326,<span style="color:white">0.798389816</span>,0.00201184502]</span> . <span style="color:white">That's amazing how a computer can express how we feel .I 'm so surprized that a computer can do that. I some time ask myself how do they do that.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.5173247539999999</span>,0.4819188619999999,0.00075639624]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I think that computers would need a lot of energy to do that I don't know it's amazing. I sometimes think that it is not impossible for this to happen but it really is. I think about all the gadgets that my mom had back then. I would usually say that they're going to make alot of different things in the future. Their already trying to make self-driving cars.</br></br>This story is amazing. I think that there are going to be more things that are going to surprise me. This one is the first greatest techonolgy I ever heard about. When I grow up I dont want to use all of this technology because I think that it is to much for me. I would consider only using something simple.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.793369162</span>,0.205965014,0.000665836466]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">This story told me alot. It told me what a computer could do that i never knew about which is surprizing. I just told my story about how i'd feel about all this new technology. That story was interesting and I think that I would probably use that one day. If I would use it I would be careful with it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.563162654</span>,0.435856032,0.000981337586]</span>
