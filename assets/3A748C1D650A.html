<span style="color:orange">Do you think technology can read your emotion</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> ? <span style="color:white">In my opinion I believe technology can't read your emotion</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">First of all, emotion has to do with what you're thinking about</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">a face can lie</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">and a drawing doesn't always mean it's happy when there is dark around it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">First of all, when you try to see someone's emotion you don't really pay attention to their face you pay attention to how they act and how they talk</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Someone can be hyper and talkative some days and the next they can be smiling but not hyper or talking to anybody. Kids come to school and put on a happy face when actually they don't want to be there. It's the same with everything else.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Secondly, <span style="color:orange">a face can lie</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . Everyone has something they're thinking about but nobody knows exactly what they're thinking about. <span style="color:orange">Everyone hides their emotion a certain time in life; therefore, you can easily smile but it doesn't mean you're happy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Lastly, in the story the author talks about how they can also use the new technology they made to know the emotion of drawings like Mona Lisa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When you look at the picture of Mona Lisa you see her smiling but the picture has to color and the smile does not look like a real smile, it looks like a fake smile. Also, in the picture of Mona Lisa the background is of a lonely lake or pond which is also without color. Color shows alot of emotion depending on the colors you use, like dark colors determine sadness and bright colors determine happiness but red is in between and usually determines hate; someone being angry.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, technology can not read emotions. Emotion has to do with what is going on in your mind, facial expressions can easily lie, and emotion in drawings determine the colors of the the art.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
