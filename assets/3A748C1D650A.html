Also, in the picture of Mona Lisa the background is of a lonely lake or pond which is also without color. Color shows alot of emotion depending on the colors you use, like dark colors determine sadness and bright colors determine happiness but red is in between and usually determines hate; someone being angry.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.564851074,<span style="color:white">0.4312469339999999</span>,0.00390197264]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, technology can not read emotions.
