Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME</br></br>and I wanted to talk to you about the cell phone policy with you.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.442283896,<span style="color:white">0.552720932</span>,0.0049951699399999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">My opinion on the policy is to not have cell phones out at all.
