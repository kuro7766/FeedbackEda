Where we generally park in like parking lots, parking garages, street parking, home driveways, and home garages are all forbidden. In Vauban their streets are completely car-free. They do allowed cars there but some people just want to walk to safe their community. But if you have are car you can only park in two places. Those two places are your house, and large garages at the edge of the development. I would never give up my car to live in Vauban, Germany. In matter of fact 57% of people have sold their cars to live there. To believe or not 70% of Vaubans families do not own cars. To me its hard to think that people actually walk everywhere they go.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.63450906</span>,0.361730968,0.0037599542399999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Paris bans driving to clean the air of the global city because of pollution.
