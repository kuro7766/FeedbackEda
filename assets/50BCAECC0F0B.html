Some important choices cannot be made with any bias, for example if you owned a company and needed to pick employees to hire picking your niece who as no experience in the field, nor any desire to work at your company is not a good choice. However using advice from other workers who help run the company you could find someone to pick with more experience and with desire to work there. Bias in this case would not be good for your choice, so using others advice you can avoid it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0028085697119999,0.0982439994,<span style="color:white">0.898947418</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Using the advice of more then one person is a great help for you.
