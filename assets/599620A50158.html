Students should at least have a detention or even an in school suspension. Students need to know their boundaries and what happens when they cross them. Discipline is a great way to turn students off their cell phones</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.147884769</span>,0.78846052,0.0636547091999999]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:yellow">Cell phones are huge distractions in school. They lead to high school drop outs because of their grades and, not to mention, they lead to low income. If we let students use cell phones more in school they may get the thought they can do whatever they want. We need to put a stop to this now so our future generations will be able to support their families.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0221848919999999,0.6588228,<span style="color:white">0.3189923019999999</span>]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
