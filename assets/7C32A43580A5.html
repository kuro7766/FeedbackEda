Now we want cars to drive us places? The world is getting lazy. America is one of the countries with the highest obesity rate, now driving a car has nothing to do with your weight, but it has something to do with your mind. When driving a car you have to be alert. Not only for yourself but for others around you. When I drive my mother always tells me to watch myself and the people around me, because you may be paying attention, but others might not be. When growing up getting and driving a car at 16 is almost every teenagers dream, but how will the future teenagers of the world get that experience if we have driverless vehicles? When I got my license it was a feeling of accomplishment. I had read that long drivers manual forover a month and when I took both of those test I was ready, but with a driverless car will a person even get that feelling? Will they even need a license or even a car of their own?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.226387044,<span style="color:white">0.6241542279999999</span>,0.149458736]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Now I get what the article says about driverless cars use less fuel than a normal one, and "Driving fun in a new way".</br></br>Having a driverless car would be pretty cool.
