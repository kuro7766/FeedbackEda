But becasue Obama won Florida he remained in office as our president. With this Electoral vote its a amke or break. Its not always the best thing but its the right thing. With the Electoral College you vote for a slate of voters who then vote for president. As Richard A. Posner informed us, " Its entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular vote than Bush yet fewer electoral votes."</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.220724078,<span style="color:white">0.7360193500000001</span>,0.0432565612]</span>  This shows you that <span style="color:orange">the Electoral Vote is more important.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1788936809999999,<span style="color:white">0.8118113539999999</span>,0.00929499628]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The Swing States are what determines the election.
