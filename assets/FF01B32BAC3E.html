This technology that is being used is not going to tell you everyone is mad or sad, happy, angry. I dont have the same mad as someone else would so what i make one face and im mad? it could just be my face and the way i look and your gonna tell me that i am mad when you really dont have a clue. We cant tell if someone is mad or sad, depressed or even happy they have those feelings themself and sometimes people dont want others to know if there upset so then your just invading there privacy. That could just make things ten times worse than what it already is. There are things we want people to know and that we dont want people to know and its our decsion on whether we want them to know.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.7537140499999999</span>,0.243334102,0.0029518461119999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">So yes i disagree with this facial expression technology i dont think we should be invading others privacy that way i think we need to have way more respect for others than what we do now.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.2241425227999999,<span style="color:white">0.772262888</span>,0.00359460458]</span>
