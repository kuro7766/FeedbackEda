All students should at lest do one activity rather than academics. This decision should be allowed if a student wants to do a activity or not. Would you want to participate in a extracurricular activity?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.364991458,<span style="color:white">0.629397126</span>,0.00561143298]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I agree because students move around when playing sports</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.178314551</span>,0.81742132,0.00426412516]</span> . <span style="color:white">Most students that play in a team could play the sports that they like.

Some students would rather sit and work with the yearbook. Some just want to help other people in the school. All academics should be for one half of school time and activity the second half. The activities would help students refresh their brains and forget the things they are going through.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1345116488,<span style="color:white">0.845637712</span>,0.0198506353199999]</span>  What activity would you like to do?
