The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.00279409074,0.148086694,<span style="color:white">0.84911925</span>]</span>
