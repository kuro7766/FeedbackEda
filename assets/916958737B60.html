Typically when teachers ask how much sleep their students get at home the in my experience the usual response is five to six hours. The recommended amount of sleep teens should be getting at least is eight hours and at most ten. The teachers on the other hand aren't surprised by those numbers the students come out with due to how many of them play sports and take AP classes. This can also cause a lot of stress like on test days, important sports competitions, or cramming in assignments last minute because other classes are assigning multiple projects due in the same week.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0490308142,0.612711934,<span style="color:white">0.338257272</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Attending classes at home would mean they have the option to start thier classes at a later time assuring that they can sleep in in the morning to get the extra few hours they're missing out on.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0171672496,<span style="color:white">0.5405813800000001</span>,0.442251372]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Not getting enough sleep effects the productivity of the student which could prevent them from finishing papers on time then having their grades drop.

For example: A teen who is more anti-social would have a harder time than someone who is much more comfortable talking with big crowds. Or even someone whose being bullied or have a mental issue they can't do anything about. This could also induce stress to the teen when assigned a group project or assignment</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0600033857999999,<span style="color:white">0.715359144</span>,0.22463748]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Attending an online course would help them in that manner of not being comfortable around others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.026806479,<span style="color:white">0.653531852</span>,0.31966169]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Could not having friends also be a problem?

It can also help work on their independence in the future with colledge or a day job. Even though it can also cause a few problems like laziness, it can easily be solved through motivation. Overall it should be provided by more schools so that parents can consider it an option.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.0188740677999999,0.657435312,<span style="color:white">0.3236906139999999</span>]</span>
