They also could be inside of the butte because the planet is deadly for some paticular reason and they have shelter inside safely away. And another reason is because inside of the planet there may be some source of running water that is keeping them alive.</br></br>Although this could not work because they more than likely would have gotten a picture of a martian outside doing something.

Because the clearer picture shows that it now looks nothing like a face, water stopped flowing on the red planet a long time ago, and Earth also has these land forms all over the place.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0383499478,<span style="color:white">0.8702801499999999</span>,0.091369919]</span>
