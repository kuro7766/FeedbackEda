Simply because some kids learn better at home,in some cases it could be there is less distractions surrounded around them for examples class clowns,bullies,girls,friends and maybe even the class pet</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0737771658,<span style="color:white">0.899807998</span>,0.0264148469999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">But don't get me wrong there is some people who would rather learn from a teacher and be able to ask live questions.

In example when kids don't feel compturble around there peers because of the cloth they wear. Maybe because of the way they look so they don't ask questions in class.

If we did school online I know it would not last 8 hours of the day so that gives u time to rest before u go to work. Maybe even give you more time to put on the clock, also it could help with making a student better at being independent. If its like edunuity which are online classes because it shows dates and time frames for you to finish your work. It helps you learn time management and you choose when u begin your work during the day.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.073600077,<span style="color:white">0.863560938</span>,0.06283898]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">My next and final reason is if school was online we would not have to wake up early in the morning to attend school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.055272003,<span style="color:white">0.919790332</span>,0.0249376288]</span>  <span style="color:orange">we could start are online course when you wake up refreshed from a good enough amount of rest.
