My opinion <span style="color:orange">when people ask for advice is they might want help</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">a good understanding,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">to see what others are thinking, or to see a situation in somebody's point of view</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Most of the time, when you talk to multiple people you most likely really want an answer to something. Thats why most people go ask others so they can find what cab be the best answer and what makes the most sense.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Why seeking for opinions could be better? <span style="color:orange">It could be better because the answer that the person is giving could be the answer they're looking for.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Seeking for opinions is actually a good idea sometimes, you get to know what other people are thinking or others point of view of the situation</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , say <span style="color:white">if your close friend is in a different mind set as you and he/she is confused with what is going on or dont understand yall can help each other to understand and get to know whats going on in the situation and how to get a good answer and result.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>
