An example could be if you're on a football team your teammates become your friends and that gives you a whole community of people who care about you. It doesn't even have to be a team it could even be a group that likes horses, but they still have something in common to bond over. Teammates also tend to build you up, and give a boost in confidence which can help you be a stronger person.

What they might not know is colleges don't only look at grades they also look at your extracurricular s. Looking at what you did after school as well as in school helps hem see that you are able to juggle both things at once, but what they don't know is we actually enjoy it! Though it might seem like a lot especially with all of our school work, it could serve as the well deserved break we need.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.00713850868,<span style="color:white">0.160968194</span>,0.83189329]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Students have a lot on their plates between school, homework, and studying, sometimes it's good to take a break</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00499420052,0.215575636,<span style="color:white">0.779430216</span>]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">What better way to relax then do something you enjoy with other people that enjoy it as well. Playing a sport after school can help you create close friends and teammates. When you think about stress reliving one of things you might think of is one of your favorite things to do with some of your friends. Well guess what, you just explained what a club is.
