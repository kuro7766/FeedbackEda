You dont have to stare at a clock and worry about reaching your deadline. You can go back to check on your work as many times as you need to. Reviewing your work allows you to correct your mistakes. You can focus when you aren't panicing about losing time to complete an assignment. Being rushed by time can be very stressful and cause problems for a student.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Distractions are never a good thing, so why work with them? Teachers in school create rules for students to be sucessful without the distraction of a cell phone, food being handed out in class, and classmates misbehaving.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Cell phones take up most of a students day and it does not benefit them at all.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Cell phones draw students' attention by a notification, phone call, or just being on a desk. Food being handed out in class creates a ruckess by everybody wanting a snack to chew. Wrappers of candy, bags of chips, and sodas being opened creates a noise that is tempting. When a student misbehaves, teachers have the ability to write them up and let upper athorities take action. Distractions cut into the time a student has to complete any assignemnt.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Organization in life can start with school</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">You have a schedule to follow, you have different subjects, and you have a structure. As soon as your morning alarm goes off you start with your morning routine. First you shower and get dressed, next you brush your teeth, then you may get transported to school. At school they provide students with a shedule to follow. You take four classes a day and have eight in total that are seperated with lunch. Each subject has different learning styles and ways to solve problems. Everything is structured and not given to a point you can't sort things out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In school learning benifits students to be organized, gives them time to complete their work, and takes away distractions. Working in school has multiple pro's for a student's future.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
