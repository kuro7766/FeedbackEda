Dear State Senator,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">The Electoral College is a process where voters select electors who then vote for the President of the United State. But is it really that reliable? Is it better than an election decided by that of popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.00911860914,0.284306756,<span style="color:white">0.706574586</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The election process should be changed to one decided by popular vote instead of using the process of the Electoral College</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.00992207854,<span style="color:white">0.335480756</span>,0.654597156]</span> . <span style="color:orange">First of all source two states that voters can sometimes get confused on the candidate that they actually voted for since they're not direclty voting for the President.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.01652828512,<span style="color:white">0.373470898</span>,0.61000082]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Another flaw of the Electoral College also stated in source two is that "...

This wouldnt be fair because since each state casts only one vote, then the single representativ from Wyoming would only represent 500,000 voters. However the single representative from California would represent 35 million voters.
