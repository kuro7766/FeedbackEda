To Who it May Concern,</br></br><span style="color:yellow">Our school is a very complex school, with different varieties of personalities. Some people may find it relaxing to help others while some may not have the time to do so. Community service such as picking up litter on a busy high way or walking dogs for people who don't have the ability to do so would, in my opinion, builds character. Community service will help many others while making the students stop and realize that when you help people they may be helped in return.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0013924416,0.0638387741999999,<span style="color:white">0.934768728</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">I think it would be a good idea to offer community service but I do not think it should be mandatory.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.00757129302,0.261996816,<span style="color:white">0.730431898</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Helping others is very important and will not only help the person the services are being provided for but also the helper.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0313887678,0.417570866,<span style="color:white">0.5510403739999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">All and all school is a place for education some may debate , but along with education you need responsibility which some students lack.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0750583777999999,0.44074128,<span style="color:white">0.484200342</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Maybe offer certain community services as extra credit.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.013491607,0.293115078,<span style="color:white">0.69339332</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">hold a meeting 1 day a week during study hall/ advisory, or after school for dedicated students to brainstorm various ways to help the community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0377364484,0.380180812,<span style="color:white">0.5820827279999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">As the principle and the final say in all school aspects I think it would be very rewarding to every one if we started community service as a school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.01469052564,0.236643602,<span style="color:white">0.7486658960000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">It would also give the school a better name and more and more people would want to volunteer and help the school out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0240095033,0.393934642,<span style="color:white">0.582055856</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">We could hold monthly annual field trips to various highways or if that may cause unnecessary commotion even a retiring home and visit with the elders.

Parents might even want to get involved and before you know it others will want to start. If you start with something minor and work your way up others will want to participation when they thinks its easy. My proposal to you is that we offer many different variates along with different time fames to offer our time and support of those who are willing and ready to perform acts of pure good deeds to further better our community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.00323449596,0.0895111132,<span style="color:white">0.90725437</span>]</span>  I also think that in America it only takes one person to make a change and with this i say it will catch on and America will be a better place to live, love, and work in peace.
