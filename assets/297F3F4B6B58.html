<span style="color:orange">The Electoral College shows many reasons why we should change it to popular vote.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Like for instance The Electoral college is not fair</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">but by voting with popular vote not only will more people vote but more people will vote for who they want to vote and not get confused and vote for the wrong candidate.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Theres many reasons why the Electoral College isnt fair like, <span style="color:orange">how Bradford Plumer stated during the 2000 campaign a variety of states that didnt vote because of not being able to see a campaign ad and they did that because some candidates dont focus on the states that they know theyre not gonna win. But by voting with popular vote you get to vote for who you want, everone gets to vote because every state would be equal and people would vote for the president and not for the slate of electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">yes, maybe the Electoral College could be good for something for like winning</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">Also if you think about it, it could be worse like even worse than the 2000 fiasco election</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> , <span style="color:orange">and plus the Electoral College avoids run-off elections so thats a good thing if you want a clear winner</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">Other than that popular vote is much more sufficient than Electoral vote because its much more fair and with popular vote everyone votes on who they want to vote and every state gets the same, equal treatment as the others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
