I have met somebody that thinks the face of Marsis an aliencreated abject. He says this with no information at hand. I am writing this to convince him that <span style="color:orange">it is not an alien created object</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  with some first hand knowlege. " The face of Mars is defenitly an alien created stucture because there is now way thats natural,"said Earl. "Well I am going to show you three reasons why this cannot be a alien created object.</br></br><span style="color:orange">"The first reason i have to support why this is not alien made because after a NASA Surveyor revealed that the images were a naturaly formed stucture and that there was no alien monument</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> "said Spencer. <span style="color:white">This is a big give away if it was aliens we would be able to tell</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> " said Spencer.</br></br>" <span style="color:orange">The second reason I have to share is that it is an illusion</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> " said spencer. " Yea but the <span style="color:white">aliens probably wanted it to be like that</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span> " said Earl. " <span style="color:orange">No because Mars has many natural disasters such as eruptions and Mars quakes</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> , dont you think that could have formed it?"</br></br>"The last reason I have to support my theory is this." said Spencer. <span style="color:white">If aleins really did make that don't you think they would keep track of it the stucture</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span> ?" said Spencer. "<span style="color:orange">Look at these photos,you see it has parished?"</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, Earl was convinced that it wasn't aliens that did it. Spencer did a great job of convincing him and <span style="color:orange">now we can all look at that face and know it is not aliens</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> .
