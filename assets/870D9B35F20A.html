For example, I find it a terrible mistake that people picked Obama and all the stuff he had promised in the pass and still haven't kept his words. In my opinion, I think Obama daughter can build a better system than him. It whatever though, it the people choice that they want Obama to be president of the United States. I just think he just a liar to our nation.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.771033968</span>,0.225994882,0.00297115136]</span>  Now back on to the subject, <span style="color:orange">the Electoral College can be important to the system</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.282530354,<span style="color:white">0.71129474</span>,0.00617489864]</span> . <span style="color:white">The bad side of the Electoral college is that under its system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect for the president. The singel best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Us Americans should consider ourselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.36016981</span>,0.617324316,0.0225058636]</span>  <span style="color:white">If you don't like my opinion, then make a new system that is close enough to be a consensus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.604043242</span>,0.39346363,0.00249314656]</span>     Â
