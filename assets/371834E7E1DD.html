In the electoral college the voters are voting for a slate of electors, who then vote for the president. In most cases the elector votes for the candidate that their party wants, in some cases the elector has chosen the oppossing candidate to what his party wants according to the second source. Since the elector is allowed to do this that is one reason why the electoral college is unfair. Popular vote is when the people vote for the candidate they want this is truly what a democracy is when the people choose their representatives.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0104702652,0.2389198288,<span style="color:white">0.7506099199999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system in all the states,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0105612813,0.319908906,<span style="color:white">0.669529838</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">because candidates don't spent time in the states they know they will lose in. They only foucus on the states that they know they will win in or of a close chance to the other candidate, because of this there has been times when people would not see the candidates at all or they did'nt get to see a single campaign ad.
