They try to get away from me. I am always sad when I see them walk away, but at least I tried. Eventuly I gave up trying to convince them.</br></br>So here I am, on the sea, thinking about the people that I tried to get them to join. Every time that I thought about them, I think about what they are doing right now. When I was discharged, I went off to find every single one of the people and tell about my journys. They always say the same thing. "I wish I joined the program." Then we have a good talk about what they did while I was overseas. I feel like that I have more friends than I used to before.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.8650140499999999</span>,0.1307006178,0.004285345672]</span>
