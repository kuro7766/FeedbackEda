<span style="color:white">In order to assure that students are learning over the summer, some schools require students to complete summer projects during their break. Some people believe that summer projects should be student-designed, while others believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1201314532</span>,0.8074419559999999,0.072426575]</span>  <span style="color:orange">All in all, summer projects should be student-designed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0669330046,<span style="color:white">0.8452411080000001</span>,0.0878258818]</span> </br></br>First of all, <span style="color:orange">if projects are student-designed, then the students will actually want to do the project and learn things from it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.024490241,<span style="color:white">0.7215551819999999</span>,0.25395459]</span>  For example, <span style="color:orange">most of the time when teachers give students projects, they are pretty boring and students don't want to do them.

Also, if the students need help with their project, they can get the help they need from a parent, friend, or a family member.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.1173177186,<span style="color:white">0.738836212</span>,0.1438460566]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, <span style="color:orange">summer projects should be student-designed. When students design their own projects, it is easier for them and it motivates them to want to learn. Although some people may disagree, these views are correct. Students that create their own projects are less stressed out about the summer projects, therefore making them more likely to succeed on their summer project.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0277359933399999,<span style="color:white">0.7703551479999999</span>,0.2019088188]</span>
