<span style="color:yellow">You are sitting in your chair. The plastic hurts your legs and back as it curves in an uncomfortable position, ill-adapted to your person. The intolerable buzz of the air conditioningÂ that does nothing to cool the over-heated room drones at your ears, making it impossible to focus. The dull, artificial bulbs that in no way compensate for natural sunlight burn away at your eyes, giving you headache after headache. The other kids are yelling and blasting music, talking instead of doing the work you have been told to complete in an unreasonable, almost impossible time. The work you are doing makes no sense to you and you feel incompetent as those around you breeze by effortlessly. You need to ask the teacher about your work but shes busy grading papers, paying no attention to the class you have been forced into. You can not focus on a single word of your assignment, and even if you could understand it, you would not be able to complete it, because that same day youve already had three tests and two quizzes and all you want is to go home and take a short nap to recharge your brain. You long for some solution to your endless problems in the classroom, and you realize there is another way.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0005203686999999,0.0184235129999999,<span style="color:white">0.981056112</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Learning from home can solve all these problems and more.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.00470006018,<span style="color:white">0.3147978239999999</span>,0.68050212]</span>  <span style="color:orange">With the ability to work online, you not only have the comfort of being at home</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.00181451752,<span style="color:white">0.199146694</span>,0.79903877]</span> , but also have <span style="color:orange">more flexibility in your schedule,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0025969348,<span style="color:white">0.255912638</span>,0.741490414]</span>  <span style="color:orange">can learn at your own pace,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.00224161682,<span style="color:white">0.242025046</span>,0.75573336]</span>  and <span style="color:orange">can eliminate almost any distractions.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0019700651799999,<span style="color:white">0.214639654</span>,0.783390268]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">First and foremost, being able to work in a comfortable environment is crucial to focusing and being able to produce the best work possible.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0011044272099999,0.136720624,<span style="color:white">0.862174968</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">While at school, students are being crammed into small classrooms with masses of other students, leaving each individual cramped. With only a square foot of desk space to write on, and the inability to move freely due to the molecule ratio of classroom size to students present, students are unable to concentrate on a given task. Scientists have proven through various studies that being comfortable while working has a direct effect on ones ability to produce quality work. By giving students the opportunity to work away from school, the comforts of home will aid in excelling the learning process. Students are also fed ill-nutritious foods in unnaturally short lunch periods, causing masses of students to consume foods that decrease brain power. When students are given less then 15 minutes to stuff their faces with greasy carbs before being shoved back into their classrooms, the students ability to work is compromised in ways like never before. By allowing students to work at home, they also have access to more nutritious food with reasonable eating periods.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000251310356,0.0187871944,<span style="color:white">0.98096148</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">In addition to comfort, working with a more flexible schedule also benefits students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0015806839399999,0.181445994,<span style="color:white">0.8169733000000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">In high school, students are often faced with the dilemma of an overwhelming amount of tests, quizzes, or projects due on a single day. Working online with a more flexible schedule, allows a student to space out assignments as needed, improving the quality and ability to learn from each one. In addition to this, the student can also plan their learning around their personal life, and allows the student to create a schedule that does not force them to chose between an important test and seeing family that visits only once a year. The ability to have more flexibility is also scientifically proven to improve learning in scenarios at school where students are forced to sit for hours at a time. Scientists have shown that teens can only focus for hour long intervals with 30 minute breaks in between. At school, classes are, on average, one and a half hours with only seven minute breaks in between. This shows how much an online approach to schooling can greatly benefit students.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000336060886,0.0252317801999999,<span style="color:white">0.974432192</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Not only can online learning provide much needed flexibility, but it also allows students to learn at their own pace.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00149222564,0.1814743139999999,<span style="color:white">0.8170334739999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Some students are faster in some subjects then others, and even within subjects, students may struggle with different learning objectives. The freedom of learning online allows students to work at a pace that is comfortable for them. This by itself eliminates assignments such as "busy work" given to students that fully understand the material faster then others. This also allows students to fully understand the material before moving on, instead of rushing to keep up with a class that is moving to fast to allow a struggling student to keep up. Some students are very intelligent and work well in higher level classes, but simply need slightly more time to practice and understand concepts then others, which is a matter that online classes solve completely.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.000440626128,0.0387412068,<span style="color:white">0.96081816</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Finally, online schooling allows for the removal of distractions that are commonly found in the classroom.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.00144425102,<span style="color:white">0.166903662</span>,0.831652114]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">At every school, there is always a group of individuals that have no interest in being at school, and focus all of their efforts into disrupting the class. At home, you can not only rid yourself of these students who curse loudly, blast music throughout the halls and classrooms, and often start fights in the middle of class, but also other distractions such as the droning artificial lights and loud air conditioning. Schools have small budgets for large amounts of students and this causes the school to make financial choices that sacrifice quality school equipment, such as quieter air-conditioning and plumbing that doesnt shake the walls of surrounding classrooms every time someone needs to relieve themselves.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00271510396,0.239381894,<span style="color:white">0.757903014</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">While some may say that giving a student these freedoms leaves them at greater risk for slacking off completely,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Effective/0.00263568522,0.254831604,<span style="color:white">0.7425327220000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">they dont take into consideration that once these downfalls of the school system have been fixed by online schooling, students can see and enjoy firsthand what learning the the right environment can be like.
