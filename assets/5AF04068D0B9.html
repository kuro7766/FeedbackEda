<span style="color:orange">Well certenly we all have different facial expressions. But have you ever looked at somone and they look like they are made but they really are not?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Well I feel that we shlould not use tecnology to view somone's feelings.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">A lot of differnt things can be misunderstood just with one little mistake.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  I will be telling you some reasons.</br></br><span style="color:orange">Tecnolgy does not alwys read ot tell the truth.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It will be hard to tell if someone is really mad or has some feelings indide themselves if using tecnolgy. Mayeb the person can be happy and excited from the inside but from they outside they show a differnt facial expression. I feel that tecnology will just mess evrything up. We need to keep it all natural and they was it is now.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">If somoene is das you can see it nut you don't know how they feel inside.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">You can probobbly draw a picture of them or soemthing instead of using tecnology. Also any type of facial expression sould be valuable in the classroom. You can't really judge a book by it cover. So really there is no need of using tecnology to see somones looks or to make them that way. Everyone has differnt reactions to differnt things.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So I think that tecnology shpuld not be usted to identify somone or to give them a value. They are how they are and that is how it is. In a classroom ther can also be differnt values and differnt emoltional expressions. Someone might feel down but we don't know that until they talk to us or let us help them. So no tecnoligy shpuld not be allowed to try and guess someone's value or feelings.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
