Mayeb the person can be happy and excited from the inside but from they outside they show a differnt facial expression. I feel that tecnology will just mess evrything up.

Also any type of facial expression sould be valuable in the classroom. You can't really judge a book by it cover. So really there is no need of using tecnology to see somones looks or to make them that way. Everyone has differnt reactions to differnt things.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.45101916</span>,0.5458765120000001,0.00310432466]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So I think that tecnology shpuld not be usted to identify somone or to give them a value. They are how they are and that is how it is. In a classroom ther can also be differnt values and differnt emoltional expressions. Someone might feel down but we don't know that until they talk to us or let us help them. So no tecnoligy shpuld not be allowed to try and guess someone's value or feelings.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1700847087999999,<span style="color:white">0.8185432</span>,0.01137213468]</span>
