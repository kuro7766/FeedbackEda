Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">There has been a lot of controversy on weather to require all children of SCHOOL_NAME to perform community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0441673288,<span style="color:white">0.424922772</span>,0.530909894]</span>  <span style="color:orange">and although this would be good in some ways this would be worse for many reasons</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.02154285874,<span style="color:white">0.3547739319999999</span>,0.6236832160000001]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00550017074,0.226946546,<span style="color:white">0.7675532799999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00452319084,0.2003718971999999,<span style="color:white">0.795104888</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0046430343799999,0.1866598559999999,<span style="color:white">0.808697074</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">My first reason is that forcing children to work on community service is that it takes time away from extra curricular activities.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.00426085084,<span style="color:white">0.1858296028</span>,0.8099095759999999]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">It's a common known fact that America has problems with obesity. Making kids do community service would definitely take time off of children's clock that they could be doing active activities like working out or playing a sport. This would increase obesity rates in America even more, causing the life span of children in this Country to shrink.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0077337871,0.199731192,<span style="color:white">0.792535028</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">My second point is that forcing children to do community service makes it seem more like work, rather than if you didn't it would seem like something you do for fun, like a hobby.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0041424898599999,0.161444272,<span style="color:white">0.834413198</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Community service is something that should be done because kids want to help other kids, the environment or those who need help. This wouldn't only make the amount of work done plummet, but also the quality of the work. If a kid is performing community service and is really enjoying himself, he is much more likely going to get a lot done and it is going to be very good quality work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00900974356,0.192436667,<span style="color:white">0.7985535880000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">My third, and final point is that forcing children to perform community service is taking time away from children's school work or studying at home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.004134806,0.167146032,<span style="color:white">0.8287191540000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">There is no doubt that children in this very room that I'm writing this paper in are struggling to pass the 8th grade. Forcing them to do community service would only increase the number of failing students at SCHOOL_NAME. This would not only be problematic for the children that are failing, but would also hurt this schools' reputation of having good academic program.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00930525932,0.2029553308,<span style="color:white">0.787739436</span>]</span> </br></br>In conclusion forcing children to perform community service would be problematic for three reasons, <span style="color:yellow">because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00550017074,0.226946546,<span style="color:white">0.7675532799999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00452319084,0.2003718971999999,<span style="color:white">0.795104888</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0046430343799999,0.1866598559999999,<span style="color:white">0.808697074</span>]</span> </br></br>Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME, student of SCHOOL_NAME.
