In the case those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral vote. Who are the electors? They could be anyone, even if their not holding office. Who even picks these electors in the first place? Sometimes it state conventions, other times it's the state's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can we, citziens of the United States, control whom their electors vote for? Not always, and that shouldn't be.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.068493635,0.2234054259999999,<span style="color:white">0.708100918</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">In the 1960 election, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy and make it seem that a popular vote would have not gone to Kennedy. What would happen if their was a tie in the electoral vote? The case would be thrown in the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Becasue each state counts for only one vote, a single representative from Wyoming would represent 500,000 voters, 55 representatives from California who getto represent 55 representatives would have as much say as the one from Wyoming.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0371754948,0.2170044729999999,<span style="color:white">0.745820042</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This cannot represent the will of the people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0211988289999999,<span style="color:white">0.36956426</span>,0.609236896]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Now when have you changed your mind about something?

It's even unfair to the people, who sometimes don't even get to see their electors. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, they don't focus of states they know they cannot win, aiming towards "swing states."
