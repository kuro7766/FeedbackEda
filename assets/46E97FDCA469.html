The rates of car accidents are already high till this day, just imagine how high the rate would be having driverless cars. It may not even be the drivers fault, a glitch can happen with the car causing it to get into a accident injuring somebody, as said in passage 9; who's fault would it be then? The person or the manufacturers fault? That is my first reasoning opposing driverless cars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0655218128,<span style="color:white">0.8089363559999999</span>,0.1255418592]</span> </br></br>Next, my second reason was <span style="color:orange">the technology failing</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1072696399999999,<span style="color:white">0.8366460119999999</span>,0.0560843464]</span> . <span style="color:orange">We live in a society where technology advances EVERYDAY, but there is always a complications with technology. Updated technology isn't always perfect. For instence the computer system in the car could crash, shutting off the whole car, there might be a hay wire causing the car to spin out of control, causing an accident, and even a more dangerous situation the car could explode or catch on fire due to the technology. An example of today's most updated piece of technology that went bad is the "Hoover Board," many people could just be riding on it, and it could burst into flames. The same thing could happen with driverless cars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1175714188,<span style="color:white">0.79875104</span>,0.0836775532]</span> </br></br>Lastly, my last reasoning was <span style="color:white">the cost</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1187265424</span>,0.839143094,0.042130362]</span>  put into the car. <span style="color:orange">Many companies say they plan to have driverless cars by the year 2020, the amount of the Driverless Car would be a ridiculous amount of money. If someone were interested into buying it the first thing, they should ask themselves "is it worth it?" Knowing the bad outcomes that could possibly happen. Not only would the car be super expensive, but also having to fulfill the tank with gas, and gas nowadays isn't the cheapest. But the most important question asking yourself before buying the expensive piece of technology, is it really worth how much it costs?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.204976628,<span style="color:white">0.7541164419999999</span>,0.040906943]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, I am against driverless cars.
