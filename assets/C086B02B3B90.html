Don't Believe Everything</br></br><span style="color:orange">Have you ever believed something that wasn't true? I have, but before you believe it you have to find out if it's true or not. In the article it says the "face" looks like it could have been a Martian mesa. Also the shadows and the lighting could be making it look more like a face. There for if the NASA wanted to go there to get evidence it would cost them a huge budget.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.1047892051999999,<span style="color:white">0.8667741000000001</span>,0.0284367148]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">What if the "face" was a Martian mesa?

The picture could have changed how the picture came out. The human mind can form shandows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Some people said it would be a good way to engage the people and attract attention to Mars. Some people can just be fooled by them and thinking it really is a face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.183030726,<span style="color:white">0.8066880879999999</span>,0.01028119082]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">To get evidence from Mars to see if it is really a face would cost NASA a huge budget.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1493454244</span>,0.842816672,0.00783788174]</span>  <span style="color:white">Just to go to Mars is a lot, but to go there and get evidence from there and bring it to Earth is a lot. It also can effect the way back to Earth and be dangerous. They don't stop at Cydonia so they would have to plan it out and get all the supplies they would need to get there and get the evidence they need.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.40182175</span>,0.5925862820000001,0.00559198528]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">People will believe almost anything anyone says. You just got to have evidence to know if it's true or not. There are so many things to make the Martian look like a face. Like meteriods could of hit it and knock off a piece of it. They could of just got the wrong side, lighting, or shadows of it</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.141314254,<span style="color:white">0.847857512</span>,0.0108282568]</span> .
