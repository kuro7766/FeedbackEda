Dear Mr Principal,</br></br>My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am a student of your school.</br></br><span style="color:yellow">I do not think that it is a good idea to require students to perform community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">I, for one, enjoy doing community service, but if it is required, many other students may be upset and object.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The students might be upset because maybe some don't like the community, or doing any extra work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Other students may be unhappy with the idea because they may have to give up some of the extracurricular activities in order to find time to do community service work.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">First of all, many kids at my school do not have enough time to do any amount of community service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Some teens have sports, commitments, and maybe even part-time jobs.</br></br>Others may have to watch their younger siblings at home because their parents come home late at night and are unable to care for the little children.</br></br>Therefore, teens in these types of situations would not be able to do any community work, or they would have to give something up, like a sport that they love ,or a job that they need to support their family.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Second, some families do not like this community and do not agree with how it works.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The kids from those families would probably get in trouble because their beliefs, and would have to do service even though they don't want to.</br></br>This may cause disagreements with the school and the family.</br></br>I think it would be a bit unfair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Lastly, other people think that this doing community service is not important because they do not feel like part of it, or maybe they just don't like it that much.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">I know a couple of people that would never do community service, and if they had to , they would do it half-heartedly and with disdain.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Although doing community service is a great thing, should people really be doing it if they don't want to?</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe that no one should do community service if they aren't going to put their whole heart and effort into it.</br></br>If kids who don't want to do community service are required to do so, their work would probably be ineffective because of lack of their work motive.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">These are just some reasons why I think requiring students to do community service work is a bad idea.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Thank you for taking your time to read this.</br></br>From Your Student,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
