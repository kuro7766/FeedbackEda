Dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I have an idea concerning community service.</br></br>You probably are considering to make everyone to do community service and I'm on the same track</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">In my sight community service is essential.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Others may not have the time to do something they need done and we can help.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">It is also much wiser to help someone in need rather than students at home playing video games or watching television.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Service helps you feel good inside and have better self esteem and may also help you physically.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>There are many people around us that don't have the time to get things done that are very important.</br></br><span style="color:orange">Some single parents don't have time to work, do household jobs, and take care of their kids everyday.</br></br>We may not be able to help with their work but we certainly are able to help them with household things.</br></br>They would appreciate it and it will help them to feel more relaxed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Instead of a mesmerized feeling that you get watching television or playing video games, you will have a happy and peaceful feeling inside.</br></br><span style="color:white">That is much more rewarding.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Community service may also help you physically.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Hard work of cleaning or moving things is a way to be active.</br></br>The constant effort that you don't realize may be helping your strength and cardio.</br></br>Since we have an overweight problem in America it would actually help if we did more service.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Many people now days don't have very high self esteem.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">When you do service for someone else they will probably thank you over and over and say how wonderful you are.</br></br>It might actually make you think twice about yourself and try harder because you know someone cares.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think community service is very important for students to do because it helps other people, it helps you to become physically active, and it may raise your self esteem.</br></br>Even though people grumble about doing service it is really important that they do it.</br></br>In the end they will be glad they had the chance to do service for some other than themselves.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
