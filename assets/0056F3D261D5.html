<span style="color:yellow">Millions of students from various cultures and locations have a common distaste for school. Many of them confidently argue that learning from home would be much more comfortable and conducive to their learning, for they would not be limited by the pressures of an academic atmosphere, which include intimidating teachers, competitive classmates, and uncomfortable classrooms.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.0009484414719999,0.095942061,<span style="color:white">0.903109526</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Although many believe that students would benefit from attending classes from their homes, students would, in reality, be negatively affected by distance learning,</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.001111427306,0.1511383399999999,<span style="color:white">0.8477502619999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">for they would be deprived of social interactions</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.001501349,0.192010356,<span style="color:white">0.80648828</span>]</span> , <span style="color:yellow">hands-on experiences</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00206598116,0.216324784,<span style="color:white">0.781609246</span>]</span> , and <span style="color:yellow">personalized guidance from teachers.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00176596688,0.194627434,<span style="color:white">0.8036065780000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">Through online schooling, students would not be allowed opportunities to interact with their peers, inhibiting the development of their social skills. Instead of collaborating with their classmates, students enrolled in online schools would have to complete assignments independently, limiting the sharing of ideas. Without the opportunity to share and discuss ideas, students would not be able to develop significant social skills, which include patience, open-mindedness, and the ability to peacefully collaborate.</br></br>Without such skills, the students would be at a great disadvantage in future endeavors requiring teamwork, which are commonly presented throughout adulthood.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0004382315999999,0.0407540104,<span style="color:white">0.95880775</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Without physically attending school, students would exhibit delays in social development, severely impacting their future affairs.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0010027474,0.1306207488,<span style="color:white">0.868376518</span>]</span> </br></br>Additionally, distance learning does not allow for the same <span style="color:yellow">hands-on experiences</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00206598116,0.216324784,<span style="color:white">0.781609246</span>]</span>  as physical schooling does.</br></br><span style="color:yellow">In traditional science classes, for example, students participate in laboratory investigations regarding pertinent aspects of their studies. Through such activities, students are allowed to apply their knowledge and reasoning skills to create memorable understandings of the investigated topics.</br></br>Online schools, however, cannot offer such activities, confining students to less involved and therefore less effective means of learning.
