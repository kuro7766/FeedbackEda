Dear State Senator</br></br><span style="color:orange">Should the Electoral College be kept in favor? The electoral college does avoid the problem of elections. Well on the other hand, Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole agreed to abolish the elctoral college and change to election by popular vote for the president of the U.S.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span> <span style="color:orange">It is unfair to the voters because the electors elect the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  Also, <span style="color:orange">not only are the voters voting for electors,they are voting for the canidate's electors when they think they're voting for the canidate.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Choosing a president should be elected by the popular vote of people not electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">To start with,the president of the United States should be elected by the popular vote of the people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The president is there to guide and lead the people. The citizens of the U.S should have the right to vote for who they think should be president. For instance,some residents have a feeling that their votes don't count.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">To add,it is unfair to the voters because the elctors elect the the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Eventhough the electors represent your state,they don't let the people choos who they desire for president. When voting for president, it shouldn't be all about the electors. The Electoral College even has the possibility of turning voters away that voted for a canidate that has no hope for supporting their state.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Further more,<span style="color:orange">the electoral college does avoid problems.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Meaning,a canidate cannot receives a certain amount of the votes cast. For instance, when a canidate has more votes than other canidates while not receiving a clear majority oof votes. Also in big states "the Electoral College rebuild some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senat decreed in the constitution."[Richard Posner {21}]</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>
