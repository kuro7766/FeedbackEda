As stated by the article, " This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires." Driverless cars today aren't all that beneficial and requiredue the attention of drivers, how can we be positive that the new cars said to come will be ready to prevent accidents without the requirence of human attention? Not only do these cars seem to be safeless, but due to all that worl that is said to come and all the new technology, dont they seem expensive and out of reach?</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.01699141686,0.2711138504,<span style="color:white">0.7118947339999999</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">The driverless cars are said to come, but with the technology that will be invested into this project, it seems to be out of reach from those who are interested.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0085591759,0.2573061239999999,<span style="color:white">0.734134712</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">As stated by the article, "...but how much smarter did the cars need to be?

As stated by the article, " If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?" If all fails, what will the law say and who is to be blamed for? Laws will need to be undated with the upcoming driverless cars, as stated by the article, " ...in order to cover the liability in the case of an accident." Even with laws updated, not every state is allowing the testing of the new cars to come, knowing that they are unsure of the safety of others.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0315720969,0.3446334968,<span style="color:white">0.623794403</span>]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, <span style="color:orange">the subject of driverless cars has always been a fascinating idea in televison and amuse thos interested and curious, but are they safe and is it also safe to safe they are?
