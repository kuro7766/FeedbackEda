But , from my opinion , <span style="color:orange">it think it would be a better idea to just let the students use their phones in their free time. I think all the students would be very happy with that and agree with it , that way they don't have to get in trouble for texting and being accused of being a bad kid because they were texting in class. That's no fair if you get in trouble but mean while if you have free time why not use your phones while you can.?</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0439638279999999,<span style="color:white">0.90253686</span>,0.0534992925999999]</span>
