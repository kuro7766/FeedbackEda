The author also states in the text," It reminds me mostly of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho."

If aliens caused the Face on Mars it could have a been more evidence of their existance, and the Face would not look more of a landform. Otherwise, I do not believe the face was caused by aliens, more so of a landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
