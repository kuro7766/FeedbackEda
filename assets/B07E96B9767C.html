On the other hand, teachers are st school for the sole purpose of helping you learn. It is their actual job to be there to help you learn things. While computers are a tool to help achieve this goal, there are other ways to learn about things and get them explained to you.</br></br>When you are in highschool, many teachers and parents will say things to you along the lines of "In the real world" and " Highschool is preparing you for the real world". Later on in life, "in the real world", if you get bored at a job you cannot just change what you are doing. You have to continue on with it because it is your job. If we implemented this system now in schools, many kids and teens would get in their mindset that if they are bored or don't understand something, things will change for them. Kids should not rely on a computer to help them understand everything. There are teachers, classmates, parents, and other adults who can help.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0013455625799999,0.0414751368,<span style="color:white">0.957179268</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The second reason why this could be bad for our society is the accessibility.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.00455324988,<span style="color:white">0.216754554</span>,0.7786922000000001]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Not every school has computers and not every class uses them. If we were to implement this software, it could be giving an unfair advantage to the students who had acsess to it. There are still plenty of schools that may not have a computer in every classroom. Similarly, not all students and parents can afford this kind of technology. Because of how new and high-tech this software is it most likely will cost more money to be put into effect. This would cause the schools with more money to be able to get it while the schools with less funding and less money to be pushed aside and not get it.

I could piece together a song or two. Now after a few months, I can't remember the first thing about playing those chords. This example shows that if you learn something then don't do it for an extended period of time, it will take a while to relearn how to do it. Although reading emotions is nothing like playing ukulele, the same holds true; if you learn something, and rely on something else to help you do it, it is going to be hard for you to re-learn how to do it again.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.00137571002,0.057573072,<span style="color:white">0.941051218</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">People also have a right to privacy and some people may not enjoy those particular rights being breached.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.00303640672,0.163883548,<span style="color:white">0.833080052</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I am a person who does not let all of my emotions show.
