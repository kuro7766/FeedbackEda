<span style="color:yellow">Why do we vote? We vote so we can choose a candidate that we can trust to make the best decisions for our country. But what's the point of voting if we have an Electoral College. We are not actually voting to ellect a president, we are voting for electors, who elect the president.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective/0.01276873904,0.360013832,<span style="color:white">0.6272174439999999</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The Elecotral College should be shut down</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0606770325999999,<span style="color:white">0.7398412400000001</span>,0.199481736]</span> , <span style="color:orange">because everyone should have their right to vote for who they they want to vote for, not have electors do it for them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0241628178,<span style="color:white">0.5451669559999999</span>,0.43067022]</span> </br></br><span style="color:yellow">"Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."

The candidate that won popular votes, should be President, because most people agree on him and his choices. Let the people's votes count toward presidency.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.01044914314,0.309919818,<span style="color:white">0.679631038</span>]</span>
