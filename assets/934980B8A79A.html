Text in free time, lunch, and at their lockers. A lot of people would love to text people during class. I don't think they should call in class because they could be texting answers to there friends who wasn't in that class yet. That's why there should be off when they are in class. After school would also work to like when they are walking to there bus or to there car. I agree with policy 1.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1520189908,<span style="color:white">0.83988266</span>,0.0080983287]</span>
