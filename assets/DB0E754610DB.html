It was often called earths twin. Venus was also called the Evening Star,but that nickname was very misleading since it was actually a planet. Venus is also one of the most easiest planet to spot if you are standing on earth. Although venus was the closest to the planet The author also started to notice that Mars was close to earth also. Then he started noticing that sometimes Venus was closer to Mars and sometimes Mars was closer to Earth then Venus.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.7273896179999999</span>,0.271122188,0.001488161518]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Venus hasnt been explored since it is way to dangerous to be explored.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.195954954,<span style="color:white">0.8007441500000001</span>,0.0033008644999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">They would send ships that are unmanned,because when ever they would send people that were inside the paceship they would not survive the landing.

The passage states that "Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfic acid in venus Atmosphere. On the planets surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,And the Atmoshperic pressure is 90 times more greater then what we experience on our own planet".</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.34315355,<span style="color:white">0.650712512</span>,0.00613392958]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Astronomers are saying that Venus may have once been been a planet like earth. I think that he did a really good job on collenting information abou venus .i hope that one day Astronomers will be able to land on Venus safely and be able to explore it.
