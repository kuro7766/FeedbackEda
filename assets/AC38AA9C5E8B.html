As no one has thought about it, alien's could be legit. Just because we see a face on Mars means one thing, but the fact that it's whole entire bottom half of it's neck-to-bottom part is gone. Just because it changed up doesn't mean,"Oh, it must have cleared up since it's been there for a while". I doubt that because, no human being can walk on Mars with no protection on that can keep him/her alive. If your going to Mars, make sure you need a quite bit of protection. But, if you actually do see an alien, just run, because it's best staying alive instead of wind up dead in the middle of no were on Mars.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.58512021</span>,0.41134839,0.0035313777]</span>
