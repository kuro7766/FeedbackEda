Dear Senator,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I would like to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">I believe that having an Elecotral college vote helps the President have a greater chance of becoming elected.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">This process also makes it a fair game of becoming elected for President.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> <span style="color:white">It's not only about the President though. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">As I mentioned before, having and electoral votes makes it fair game for everyone.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">It states that the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that the presidential candidate cannot get votes based on the region they are from. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a President. He gains no votes by increasing pluraity in states that he knows he will win. This results with unlikely success of the President.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. When no candidate wins a majority of the vast cast, it causes complications in the presidential election process. That's when the Electoral College steps in and prodices a clear winner.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Sure it can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may not be the best way of geting potential voters for a candidate,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but the way they do things makes it fair game. It keeps the system balanced.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The Electoral College is an established compromise in the Constitution brought on by the Founding Fathers. It's something original that I think should live on instead of being taken away. The Electoral College should stay.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Signed, PROPER_NAME
