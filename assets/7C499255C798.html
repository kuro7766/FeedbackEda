For example, we can rake the leaves in fall, or shovel driveways for our neighbors. We could even collect canned goods for the hungry and poor. We can do little and big things, but still give back to you, and give back to Wauwatosa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0483039406,<span style="color:white">0.4619927</span>,0.4897033319999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If you make SCHOOL_NAME students perform community service, I can guarantee that not only SCHOOL_NAME, but our school will be a much better place.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.033586407,<span style="color:white">0.566160706</span>,0.400252882]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The students will not be as rowdy, and more kids will pick up trash laying on the floor in hallways.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0126515943999999,<span style="color:white">0.335616102</span>,0.6517323260000001]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For example, when a student drops something, more students will take action to return it to them.
