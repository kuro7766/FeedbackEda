Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I have been told that you wanted to change the policy on the grade students should have to play in sports (if you have a grade C average than you wouldn't be able to play) , and that you also wanted the students views on that. Well I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME and I know for the majority</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0771841334,<span style="color:white">0.7805768000000001</span>,0.1422390632]</span> , <span style="color:orange">most kids wouldn't think it fair if you went into action with this policy</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0489519167999999,<span style="color:white">0.8443490300000001</span>,0.1066990752]</span> , and there are other reasons you shouldn't put this policy into action too, here are some of them.</br></br><span style="color:orange">One reason why you should put this policy into action is because if the majority of the students have a grade C average at your school, then SCHOOL_NAME would lose many team members</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0525090578,<span style="color:white">0.77726419</span>,0.170226746]</span> , <span style="color:orange">this policy might make you think it would encourage kids to have better grades,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.0771683098,<span style="color:white">0.8379156139999999</span>,0.0849160526]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but it might affect the team for those who want to slack off, not even necessarily slack off because a grade C average isn't even failing</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.086045852,<span style="color:white">0.81652854</span>,0.097425615]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Unless you want the school's reputation to go down by losing many games because they have little members, than you could follow through with this policy. But I wouldn't encourage it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.243331136,<span style="color:white">0.730900264</span>,0.0257685756]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Another reason why I wouldn't encourage putting this policy into action is because a grade C average isn't considered failing, and in most schools for activities they won't let you participate if you are failing, but it would be fine with them if you had a grade C average.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0491463378,<span style="color:white">0.709406232</span>,0.241447442]</span>  <span style="color:white">Not that we are in competition or anything but I am sure SCHOOL_NAME wants to be represented as a good, cool, and fair school.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.4666151619999999</span>,0.517116778,0.01626807138]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also another reason could be because maybe a student has a grade average C in one of their elective classes, now that definitely wouldn't be fair if someone didn't get to do sports because they had a grade average C in an elective class.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0466534024,<span style="color:white">0.7256373159999999</span>,0.22770929]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Electives are supposed to be a privilege, not something you should base whether they play sports or not. And the fact that they had a grade average C in that class and saying that they couldn't play sports wouldn't be fair because if they aren't even failing the class then they should have the right to play.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.170153992,<span style="color:white">0.7797012560000001</span>,0.0501447525999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">These are a few reasons why you shouldn't tell kids they can't play sports if they a grade C average. Think these reasons over and thank you for the time being that you read this letter.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.216108686,<span style="color:white">0.762123478</span>,0.0217678424]</span> </br></br>- A concerned SCHOOL_NAME student.
