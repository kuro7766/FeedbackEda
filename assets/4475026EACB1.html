The reason people vote is so that the person they want as president will win the race not so the person the electorial college wants to will win. The popular vote is simply deciding electors who can vote however they please which means the citizens vote doesnt make a difference wich unfair.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.194449066,<span style="color:white">0.764395852</span>,0.0411550504]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion america should have a popular vote not an electorial college because the peoples vote should matter. If you want a fair and honest goverment everyones vote should matter equaly and there should be no electorial college. If you care about what the american citizens opinions and what they have to say get rid of the electorial college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0616319931999999,<span style="color:white">0.834477</span>,0.103891036]</span>
