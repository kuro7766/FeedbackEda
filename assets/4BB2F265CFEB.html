People wish that the person that they are voting should be president. Yes we should follow the constitutuion but something we should not follow at all. On paragragh 10 it says that when you vote you don't vote for the president you vote for the slate of electors. Then they pick who should be the president. People have the chance to vote for who should be the president. For,example, when something happen in 2000 gore and bush. Gore had the upper hand and was going to will but then instead of gore winning bush on.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.366430614,<span style="color:white">0.6209028200000001</span>,0.0126665960599999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The electoral collage is good but not that good.
