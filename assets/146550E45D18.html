Even if the entire state votes for one candidate 100% the person representing the state may choose to say that the other candiate won. Therfore messing up the actual count by saying that all the people in that particular state voted for a singular candiate. Now lets be real no state is going to entirely vote for a single candidate,but lets say that Obama's count for Florida was 25% instead of the 75% it supposeably was. Obama would not have won. It is a well known fact that if not for the electoral collage Obama would not have won at all. Same with John Kerry.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.19037733</span>,0.69340978,0.1162129]</span>  <span style="color:white">Who are the elcators who voted for him?

Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter,Bob Dole and ETC all agree on abolishing the EC. After Al Gore won the presidental election in 2000 due to the popular vote of the people, The thing best known as the diaster factor came into play. The disaster factor is a fiasco that happens in the American goverment. This happened because according to the law state legislaters are techically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In 1960 this happened to then Vice President(also running for the big chair) Nixon. The state corresponders for Hawaii overthrew Nixons oppents electors votes in order for him to win. He cheated to win. He bribed the electors because lets be real who is gonna turn down 50,000 dollars? Its the electors fault that bad leadership comes to America.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.293998832</span>,0.5645305439999999,0.1414706298]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">"The EC is widely regarded as an Ananchronism"according to the article posted by Richard A Posner.
