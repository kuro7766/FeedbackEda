Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think you should allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during study halls and lunch periods</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Students really might need their phones, and if they couldn't bring their phones to school and use them at all, then they all would need to use the school phone</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If everyone wanted to use the school phone, then they would have to take turns in using it for only a certain amount of minutes</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">If a kid does get caught using a cell phone in class, then teachers can take their phones away.. just theirs'</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If we don't have our phones at school, then just think about all of the downs, and complaining their would be!</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">I don't think you want that though</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Let us be able to take our phones and use them! We won't want to get our freedom from them, so we won't text in class. If some people get caught, then they should get their's.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
