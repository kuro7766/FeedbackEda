Dear Principal, <span style="color:orange">my name is STUDENT_NAME and I have notice you have two policies for all of us students here at the school</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.40612477,<span style="color:white">0.590271156</span>,0.00360406414]</span> . <span style="color:orange">So I have came to give you my opinion on what we should do, and that is, policy 1. To me policy 1 is better</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.1326807922,<span style="color:white">0.857351518</span>,0.00996767318]</span> , <span style="color:orange">because if the office can't get in contact with any parent/gaurdian about one us students having an emergency about something or either to get a ride, it wouldn't make sense to take the phone away right?</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.076623502,<span style="color:white">0.89372401</span>,0.0296525048]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If you can't get in contact with the hospital, because a student can't breath wouldn't it make sense to just use our phone during free time if that happened to let them know, because you are usually not out during free time and if that happens it could be too late to rush the student to the hospital if we have to walk or run a long way to just get to your office or the front office to let someone know that, " hey there's a student across the other end of the school that is not breathing, then you would have to ruin all the way down to make sure so it would be to late for them to come right? Instead of just letting a student call then the ambulance would be here already and it wouldn't take forever</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.284273251,<span style="color:white">0.657646768</span>,0.0580799969]</span> . <span style="color:orange">If we have to contact our parents to let them know that we are going to be gone and miss the bus, because of school activity then we have to let them know.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.377526706,<span style="color:white">0.617766256</span>,0.00470703096]</span>  <span style="color:white">So think about it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.5371361699999999</span>,0.46064424,0.00221960626]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
