A car does not have reflexes. Therefore, if an accident happens really quick and the sensors do not alert the driver like it should be then there goes another collision. Many things could go wrong with the sensors and could cause terrible accidents.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.0739290936</span>,0.870282604,0.0557882978]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In this case who could you blame for the accidents that occur with the driverless cars?</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.046934086,<span style="color:white">0.8733942279999999</span>,0.079671696]</span>  <span style="color:orange">On paragraph 9, it describes safety, but there would be new laws to cover liability of an accident.

Accidents are most likely to occur because humans are not driving the vehicle, but the vehicle itself is driving. There would be uprises on who you can actually blame since the driver was driving but the manufacturer created it. There would be no point in getting a license if you are not driving the car. Driverless cars are going to be pointless to even own if you are not driving the car yourself.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Effective/0.035106129,0.8001469819999999,<span style="color:white">0.164746898</span>]</span>
