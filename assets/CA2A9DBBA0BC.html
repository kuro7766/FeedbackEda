Also We as on earth NASA says that they have never seen or recorded a real life alien.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.341425814,<span style="color:white">0.6555772899999999</span>,0.00299689354]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">If aliens did make this</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.279821368</span>,0.718401348,0.0017772949599999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">it would be in the news because come on how many aircrafts are sent into space a day most likly about one ever day.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.42136401,<span style="color:white">0.57643898</span>,0.00219700746]</span>  <span style="color:white">And we also have a satilite up in space and I bet you Countries like Russia, Canada, and probaly even the British have one up in space.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.3596986679999999</span>,0.6383245559999999,0.00197675348]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">And if something like that happened I would hope one of those satilites would see that happing.</br></br>And for all you and me now is that are moon has craters in it.
