<span style="color:white">I don't care what google does for driverless cars, I think they may be good for a small town such as Berne, but there are a lot of cons to this whole issue. I think it would be fun to have cars we don't have to drive ourselfs but an issue with that is what if we do get into an accidnet in a bigger city. I'm nuetral on this topic because they aren't truly driverless ars if they still need a driver.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.1140950023999999</span>,0.7859060920000001,0.0999988862]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I don't particularly care if we get driverless cars or not.
