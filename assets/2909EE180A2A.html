Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think it fair that kids who have a B average should choose a sport but kids how have F. Should not be able to choose a sport</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  because then <span style="color:orange">they worried more about there sport. Then about school or school work then they don't have time to do there homework.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Then they might even fail the grade there in. But people who have a B should be able to choose a sport because there doing well in school. And not failing in school there tried hard so they should be able to choose a sport that they like. But if they start doing bad in school or not doing there homework and start to get an F they should talk to the student. And tell him/her if they have a sport and still have</br></br>B average or in the next test they take and get an F. there going to have take away there sport till she /he has better grades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>
