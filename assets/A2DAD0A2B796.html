It's a bigger chance of a student getting a better grade on the project because , they can do a project about sports , music , hobbies , and things students like to do during off time . If the project was teacher - designed , students will have to do projects about math , social studies , and science , things that students wouldn't want to do a project on because it's less fun and boring .</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Students work best when they can do their own project their way</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  . <span style="color:orange">Students work best when they can do their own project their way</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  because , a lot of students dislike when the teacher want them to do a project their way and the project is about something they dislike doing , and the teacher have things set up their way .
