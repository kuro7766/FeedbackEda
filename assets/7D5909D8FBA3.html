Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">Community service would be a great thing for every student to be required to do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Even though some people may think it is a pretty big time waster</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span> , <span style="color:orange">helping the community is doing an act of service, which every student should be able to enjoy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe that doing community service would help the community,</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">make students feel good</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , and <span style="color:orange">encourage good work skills</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> .</br></br>Doing community service helps the community out tons.</br></br><span style="color:orange">People always like having a good deed be done for them.</br></br>People have jobs for each thing we could help out with, but they would LOVE for us to help them.</br></br>I mean, wouldn't you like it if somebody helped you in your job?</br></br>Doing community service is a great way to help us to feel good about the community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">The people who don't like the idea usually become pessimists who hate everything,</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective]</span>  and <span style="color:white">we wouldn't like to make students feel that way.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">We should encourage students to work hard for the community.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Another upside about doing community service is that it will <span style="color:orange">make students feel good</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  and happy.</br></br><span style="color:orange">Doing service means that you're doing something good, which makes you feel good about yourself.</br></br>I think community service would help everybody - our community, our school, and the students.</br></br>Requiring each student to do community service would be a great idea, and it might make the students feel better then they have been.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Also, if we require community service for each student, it might encourage them to do even more work.</br></br><span style="color:orange">They might feel so good about their decision, that they do some more service when it's not a requirement.</br></br>It might change into a personal goal instead.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Community service will change people's lives and attitudes for the better. They will be in a better mood, and they will live a more happier life.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think it would be best to require community service for all students.</br></br>Community service can help people, make students feel great, and encourage them to always do more.</br></br>Community service is a great idea for the students to do and enjoy.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
