If kids don't have and opportunity to play a sport because of their "C" that's no reason to take away their dream. What if they want to become a professional swimmer? You're just going cut down their dream tree just because of a "c'?</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Effective/0.00805002796,0.271962612,<span style="color:white">0.719987366</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">I have a "C" in math, and swim is coming up-you're just going to take away my chances to beat my times from last year?</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.0312241353</span>,0.501975076,0.466800772]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I could grow up and become something amazing and thank you one day for the opportunity of being able to swim, but now you have taken my-and other swimmers "the ride away".
