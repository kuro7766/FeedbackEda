<span style="color:orange">This face has been the talk of NASA and the talk of headlines for quite sometime. The topic has been argued many times and there are many different opinions on whether or not its a face or a natural landform. What do you think?</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.0521809718,<span style="color:white">0.776478244</span>,0.1713407881999999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The discussions of this being a face are all over the place, poeple believe that ailens have caused this "face" on Mars surface. There are three different pictures, one from 1976, one from 1998, and one from 2001. In the first pictuere you see a outline of a face and a mouth, but back in the 70's the quality of technology wasn't very advanced. In the first photo, due to poor quality, it is just a land mass that has trhe outline of a face</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0597584192,<span style="color:white">0.74565189</span>,0.1945896752]</span> . <span style="color:yellow">There is no form of life on Mars, otherwise, NASA would have detected in years ago.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.066707752,0.7789120900000001,<span style="color:white">0.154380186</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In the article it says that the camera that was used to capture the 1976 photo only had 43 meters per pixel, in other words meaning that there's almost no way in telling what the first picture was or resembled.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0930586482,<span style="color:white">0.840499426</span>,0.0664419222]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In 1998 and 2001, you can see the picture more clearly due to the advancement in technology you clean clearly see that there is no outline or resembalance of a face.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0636446344,<span style="color:white">0.874399186</span>,0.0619561574]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">The Face is nothing but a landmass, the scientific name: A mesa.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0389155164,0.771301808,<span style="color:white">0.1897826732</span>]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In the '98 photo the picture is foggy and unclear because it was winter on Mars and they had to take a photo through a cloud.
