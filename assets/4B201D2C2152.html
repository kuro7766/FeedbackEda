<span style="color:orange">Talking to three people will help anybody with something they cant decide on. If somebody says one thing and then you say another. The only solution is to only get help from one other person. So that you could have three including yourself.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Their is no reason to have only ask one person something because when anyone ask three people something, its bound to have a answer because its three people and there is an odd number of people.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Studies have shown, when anybody ask more than one person a for advice then it gets solved quickly.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Whenever there is two people and they gives you advice that you disagree with. All everyone should do is just ask one more person for advice. After that then you will finally know just side with the person that likes your idea. The next time you you want advice from one person remember this.</br></br>One person is greater than two. If anyone were to ask a group of three. With you making four, there will most likely be a tie. Lets say you pick blue and one other person goes with you, that remains two more and they like orange. that means there is a tie.</br></br>So basically what i'm am saying is that. When a group of people have a even number there is a impossible chance of solving witch person to go with for advice</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:orange">Okay when you talk to one person then it could be helpful to take advice from them.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">But its a better idea to ask two because now there is another side to just that one earlier.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">If your friend were to get in a fight. And you were right there. The principle isn't just going to take you side. They will see if the other kid could tell there side, so that they will have more than one side of the story</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">The next time you ever take advice from one person remember to just ask one more.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span>
