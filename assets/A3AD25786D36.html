Nasa has been doing test to figure out something that can stand the venus enviroment. They haven't sent a spacecraft to venus in three decades. ''The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familir features such as valleys, mountains and craters.'' Venus is the nearest option for us. Venus was probably covered largely with oceans so it probaly could support human life but we still have to take the risks. how would we live on a planet that doesnt even have what we need to survive.
