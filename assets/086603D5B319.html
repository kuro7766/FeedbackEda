If students don't like the activity they have to do, why do they have to take that activity? The poor students wouldn't have time to breath, and go home. Students relaxing time would be school time, so which one do you choose? Forcing students to live under school, or allow students to have their own life after school, with no consequences.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0689248454,<span style="color:white">0.805365454</span>,0.1257097032]</span>
