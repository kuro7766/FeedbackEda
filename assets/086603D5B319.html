<span style="color:yellow">It's 9pm, you haven't finished your homework. You would've finished your homework, if you had the choice to go straight home. However, the extra curricular you have to participate in, took too much time. That's the view of a student, if they would have to participate in a extracurricular activity. Students would have no time to play their Xbox, and have no time to finish that 8 paragraph essay, if they had to participate in a extracurricular activitiy</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Effective]</span> <span style="color:orange">.

If students don't like the activity they have to do, why do they have to take that activity? The poor students wouldn't have time to breath, and go home. Students relaxing time would be school time, so which one do you choose? Forcing students to live under school, or allow students to have their own life after school, with no consequences.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>
