I can't believe people don't just use this rule. Some people throw there trash on the streets then we have to pick it up. I think its not fair for the rest of us that we have to pick up other peoples trash. Sometimes i think some people are disgusting at the way we treat this world. We should treat it like its our nice house. I also think that people could use the three R' s.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.3474455019999999,<span style="color:white">0.5806109079999999</span>,0.0719436114]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If we don't keep up on the community service our family which is the world will fall apart because of the litter.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.1020210866,<span style="color:white">0.824416866</span>,0.0735620469999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I care for this planet and I hope there's other people out there that care to about this giant family (world).
