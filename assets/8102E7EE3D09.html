When we vote for our president, our votes don't exactly count. <span style="color:orange">We just vote for representatives to go vote for the president. Many people would have won by majority vote, but the electoral college had more votes for the other side.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Continuing on, the electoral college is very outdated. <span style="color:orange">The Founding Fathers used it when they were alive. I think that America is a little past that, because that was three hundred years ago. Why still use something that old? It is pretty irrational to still use the electoral college.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Finishing off, the electoral college is very irrational. It makes no sense to have a process that long to do a somewhat simple thing. <span style="color:orange">Even other Americans believe that the election should be based off of majority vote. Sixty percent of them believe that to be true! The electoral college is a waste of time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">All in all, the electoral college is just a waste of time, and process. It takes to long for the president to be voted in. It also makes no sense because our votes dont even count. Most of us believe it should go away, by majority vote,too</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> .
