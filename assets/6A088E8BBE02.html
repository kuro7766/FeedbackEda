The electors can be picked in many different ways. Sometimes they are they are picked at state conventions, they can be picked at state party's central committe, or sometimes the presidental canidate picks them themselves according to Bradford Plumer (source 2).</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0112905216,0.252362628,<span style="color:white">0.7363468400000001</span>]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Plumer says that voters can't always control who their electors vote for and sometimes voters get confused on who to vote for.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Effective/0.0052421874799999,0.203195666,<span style="color:white">0.79156218</span>]</span>  The system to pick electors can be bias. For example in 1960, segregationist in the Louisiana legislature almost achieved in replacing the Democratic elecotors with electors who would not elect John F. Kennedy. Meaning if Kennedy would have gotten the popular vote in Louisiana, he still would not have gotten the electoral votes in the state.</br></br><span style="color:orange">In the case of a tie, the electoral college would yet again be an unfair system.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0057410720999999,<span style="color:white">0.207009758</span>,0.7872491600000002]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">If there was a tie in the election, the election would be given to the House of Representatives. In that election, each state has only one vote. So a state with a bigger population has the same say than a state with a smaller population. According to Plumer, because many voters vote one party for president and another party for Congress, the House's selection will not entirely reflect the will of the people. A tie in the electoral college is possible beacause the amount of electoral votes is 538 which is an even number (source 3).</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Effective/0.0076564164999999,0.1445501448,<span style="color:white">0.8477934460000001</span>]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The electoral college is also unfair to voters because of the winner-takes-all system.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.00980865634,<span style="color:white">0.256549044</span>,0.73364229]</span>  <span style="color:orange">The winner-takes-all system awards all the electors to the winning presidential canidate (source 1). According to Plumer because of the winner-takes-all system canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning (source 2).</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.0117599330399999,<span style="color:white">0.302300166</span>,0.685939876]</span>  <span style="color:yellow">Counterclains suggest that because the election depends on the vote of swing states, voters there are more thoughtful and should be the ones to decide how the election goes (Richard A.
