Dear Principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think Policy 1 is better, because then you can bring your brand-new phone you got from a celebration or for a reward.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Policy 2 says cell phones are not allowed , then what is the reason to have a phone if your not allowed to have it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Lets say your parent/parents are being held up and can't pick you up from school, so then somebody else has to pick you up or take the bus home. You play for the school's baseball team and a last minute game was scheduled and you have to play today in 30 minutes, but your parent/parents doesn't know so how are going to get a ride home. You have to get your or borrow somebody else phone to call him/her.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">There is a bomb threat and the terr says if the police comes the school will blow up, so you have to secretly call the police tell them what the person said and the information he/she is giving while the teacher is asking questions. The police finds out who the person is and tracks the call and arrest the terrorist.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">There is a fire and somebody was hurt, so you or somebody has to call the 9-1-1 to put the fire and see if the victim was seriously hurt. there was an earthquake and somebody broke their leg and you are trapped with the victim, so you have to call 9-1-1.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">That is why you should use Policy 1.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
