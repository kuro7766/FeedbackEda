Principal:</br></br><span style="color:white">I think that bring your phone to school and using them at lunch, break and other free times is a good idea.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">Because as long as they turn it off at the end of the time giving then there should be no problem.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I know you probably think that people would go behind your back and leave there phones on</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but if they do and they get caught they should get in trouble for it. I really don't see a problem with taken your phone to school and using it at free time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Also, if they don't obey the rules then they can pay the consequences.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Using phones at school is not no big deal if you think about it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Because we have eight hour in school and I think it is right if you let us use it when free time is giving to us, but not during class time. I know school means a lot but i still think we should get a free time and let us check our phones. School is not a joke, it is important i know that, but i bet you over half of the school checks there phones when they can.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In all, i think students should be allowed to use there phones when they have free time. Education is very important, but remember we have eight hours in school and I don't see any problem checking them at lunch, break or free time. i don't think its right sneaking behind your back and people trying to check there phone so instead of them going behind your back the free time giving to them they can check it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Thanks,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
