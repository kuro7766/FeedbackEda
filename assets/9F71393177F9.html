I know school means a lot but i still think we should get a free time and let us check our phones. School is not a joke, it is important i know that, but i bet you over half of the school checks there phones when they can.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.309553922,<span style="color:white">0.68353674</span>,0.00690931696]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In all, i think students should be allowed to use there phones when they have free time. Education is very important, but remember we have eight hours in school and I don't see any problem checking them at lunch, break or free time. i don't think its right sneaking behind your back and people trying to check there phone so instead of them going behind your back the free time giving to them they can check it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.1351737019999999,<span style="color:white">0.850348612</span>,0.01447767066]</span> </br></br>Thanks,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
