The most votes that are needed for being elected for president are 270 votes. Each candidate running for president has his own group of electors. The are generally chisen by the candidate political party so is fare. So Im sure that you are going to consider this and read it because some people dont thhink about it. Some dont know how it works and vote for a new one because it sound better but is not.</br></br>I just want to make sure people are inform with. That they read this and tthink about it. This is only held every 4 years on the tuesday after the first monday of november. So you might not want to make a big mistake making this decision. People might think that this is not that big of a deal but it is. This very important for the president and the government. This only happens Every 4 year so you got to wait a long time.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.87211474</span>,0.1264016826,0.0014835603799999]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I am very imform about this and making a change will only make thinks worse.
