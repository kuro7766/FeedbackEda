This is very important if you want to make the best decision. If you don't seek other opinions, you'll only consider your point of view. Your point of view may not always be the best point of view.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">After considering multiple opinions, you have different point of views or opinions. Now, you can compare those opinions to each other.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Out of those opinions, you should narrow those opinions down to just a few. Then, you should compare the other opinions to yours. After that, you can make a better decision.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>Lastly, <span style="color:orange">some people have more experience than you in certain areas.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Some people probably had to make the same choice you are currently about to make. They may have made a bad decision and can give you suggestions on the best choice for you. You will then have more than enough knowledge before you make your decision. This will help you make the best choice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>In conclusion, there are many important decisions you have to make in life. In order to make the best choice, you should consider many opinions. I say this because some people have more experience than you, <span style="color:orange">everyone has a different opinion</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> , and you can compare those opinions. Your point of view is not always going to be the best point of view. With that being said, if you seek multiple points of views, you will have the knowledge to make the best choice possible.Â
