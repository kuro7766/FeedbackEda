Dear principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I believe that allowing student to bring phones to school and using them during lunch period and free time but as long as the phones are off during class time is a bad idea</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">because what if the student don't listen to the policy and they have there phones out during classes and there texting during there class and when the teacher ask what is the answer to "2836/847 they don't the answer how they be able to learn.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">Here's an example I think I can bring my phone to school and text, call, go on the internet go on facebook do what ever i want do and if it goes to far. That student will start to fail school and not doing the homework. That student will start going to classes. Then start skip school her so cool and popular.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I also believe don't allow student to have phone at school at all is another bad idea because what if student needs to call home call someone else what if a group of student are walking to school and someone got shot</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">how would they call the police if there phones are at home that student will be dyeing right before the other students eye what would you do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">So here's policy 3 the student are allow to bring they phones to school but at all time it has to be turned off and in your locker inside your book bag.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Ineffective]</span> </br></br>sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
