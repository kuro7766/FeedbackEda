<span style="color:orange">I like this feature. I'd consider it very helpful on both computers and robots.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Regarding robots, I wonder if Baymax from Disney's "Big Hero 6" had something like it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">He was like a robotic nurse as explained by the main character. However, it wouldn't work in concrete tunnels.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Regarding computers, if the feature could have come out a bit sooner, then Nickelodeon could've used it for a non-animated TV show they came out with, called "I Am Frankie".</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:white">I'm still waiting for the show to continue. In one of the last two episodes of this show, one of the judges for this competition that was like a quiz show said that computers can't feel human emotions, but a girl who was part computer proved her wrong. I like this show because it gives me proof of how smart computers are.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">In conclusion, this feature should be used in all computers.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">I'd like for it to be used in robots too, that way robots could take the expression and mimic it</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> . <span style="color:white">I'm pretty sure the "Transformers" movies have something like it too. If the "Transformers" movies and "Big Hero 6" use it then it was probably already thought of.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  <span style="color:orange">With computers, someone could type into the computer "How am I feeling today?" and the computer could respond with an emotion like said computer has ESP.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span>
