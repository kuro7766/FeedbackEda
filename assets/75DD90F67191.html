In 2001, the pixels were only 1.56m per pixel. The quality is worse the bigger the pixels.</br></br>In 2001, the quality of the pixels were clear enough to show that the "face" was only a lanform. In the picture of 1976, it is visible that the picture is blurry. In the picture of 1998, the picture is less blurry, but still hard to see. In the 2001 picturer, the picture is very visible and well seen. At the bottom of the mesa, it is also visible to see the lanform has a rounded, smooth, almost non man-made surface that buried the landform into the planet side.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.202711908,<span style="color:white">0.757312272</span>,0.0399757916]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Next, the Internet, showed what the scientists and the picters showed.
