Dear principal,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I personally do not agree with the choice you are considering.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Sports and other activities are very important to some and most students</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:orange">These activities allow them to have a chance to relieve the stress that school has caused them</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> .</br></br><span style="color:white">If students where told that they wouldn't be able to have the rights in participating, unless they have a B average or higher, this would cause them nothing but more stress than what they already have.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Some students rely on sports to keep them motivated.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">With no sports or other activities students grades could lower past a C average.</br></br>Also, you must put into consideration that if the majority of students have a grade of C average.</br></br>Some may not be able to improve their grades.</br></br>They may already be trying as hard as they can.</br></br>If so, it would become unfair for those students to not be able to participate in sports.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Having these activities open to all students even if they have a C average or a B average, could also help improve their grades.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">Sports and other activities include teamwork, motivation, and consequences.</br></br>These 3 things are not only needed to help students achieve in sports but to achieve in school too.</br></br>In the classroom, students need to know how to use teamwork and motivation.</br></br>This will allow them to use teamwork in groups to help improve ones grade.</br></br>And motivation will cause one to achieve their work assignments.</br></br>And having these available to them, they will know the consequences of not using them correctly.</br></br>These will result in bringing students grades up.</br></br>Making you happy with their grades and them happy being able to still participate in sports.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>Your fellow student
