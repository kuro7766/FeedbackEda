After the presidential elction, your governor prepares a "Certificate of Ascertainment"Â  listing all of the canidates who ran for president in your state, as well as the names of their respective electors</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">Under the electoral college system voters not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.
