Dear Principal</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think that we shouldn't have to do community service if we don't have to time to do it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:white">Say if we play sports we wouldn't have the time of day to it and if you make us do it on weekends kids might not show up or some might become upset with you.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Ineffective]</span>  So i think <span style="color:white">you should let the kids pick or if they do it give the some extra credit</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  . <span style="color:orange">I play sports and I only have time to help on the weekends and sometimes i will be tried and many other kids who play sports might feel the same way as I do.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:white">But if you do pick to make kids do community service I will understand</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Ineffective]</span>  why <span style="color:orange">it helps kids learn to help out other people besides your self and some kids can really learn from just helping a couple of people out. But its up to you there are some positives and negatives with this choice.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">I think we should take a vote to see how many kids would like to do community service and who wouldn't. If a lot of kids don't then let the kids who want to go out and help do it.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate]</span>  <span style="color:orange">For the kids who don't maybe they will change their minds if their friends tell them how fun it is because they still are hanging out even if they are helping people out while they are doing it. I wouldn't know which to pick for a while i would ask my friends if they do it to give me some positives and negatives on it. Then i would try it and see if i like it and if i do i will keep going along with this act.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So this is a hard choice for you to pick but i would just go by the vote of your students. Plus maybe a lot of kids will choose to do community service and you wouldn't have to make everyone do it</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate]</span>  . Since i wrote this paper <span style="color:orange">I think i would vote to do community service</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate]</span>  and i think i would convince some more kids to go along with this just to see how it is. Then I see they whole school would come along to do this .</br></br>Thank you for reading this letter</br></br>Your student
