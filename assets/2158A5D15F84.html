<span style="color:orange">On May 24, 2001, about 25 years ago the NASA's viking spacecraft was circling the planet. It then spotted a human like face. It was huge! It was nearly two miles long. It looked like it had been staring back at the camera from where this picture had been taken.</span> <span style="color:red">[Lead,Adequate/0.196243106,<span style="color:white">0.7806963839999999</span>,0.0230605485]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">The face is clearly a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.072668658,<span style="color:white">0.912662266</span>,0.0146690743]</span>  <span style="color:orange">When Mars Global flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin snapped a picture ten times sharper than the first photo. When this picture was taken it was a very cloudy day. This means that the camera had to peer through all the clouds to get this good of a picture</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.205498315,<span style="color:white">0.783092036</span>,0.0114096485999999]</span> . <span style="color:orange">But skeptics say that the aliens images were hidden by the haze.</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Adequate/0.195839788,<span style="color:white">0.7962843600000001</span>,0.00787585066]</span>  <span style="color:white">That cannot be true becasue if the aliens were hidden we would not have such a great picture of the faces. That completly shows that there is proof that this face is just a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.19727174</span>,0.794216108,0.00851216234]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">This is a great natural landform and it is very questionable at first, if this could really just be a natural landform. But knowing that the NASA has went out more than one time and taken pictures of this face really does show that it is not aliens. Not only have we taken pictures but we have proof. These are all the reasons why it is certain that this face is a natural landform.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.0820221842,<span style="color:white">0.883602214</span>,0.0343755874]</span>
