dear TEACHER_NAME,</br></br><span style="color:orange">I think community service is a great idea for kids here at our school to participate in.</span> <span style="color:red">[Position,Adequate/0.0362429902,<span style="color:white">0.781733402</span>,0.1820235908]</span>  <span style="color:white">Kids are saying it takes to much time way</span> <span style="color:red">[Counterclaim,Ineffective/</span> <span style="color:white">0.134554002</span>,0.8259616920000001,0.0394843304]</span>  <span style="color:orange">but, why be watching t. v when you could go help clean up litter to make a better environment for us.</span> <span style="color:red">[Rebuttal,Adequate/0.0734139912,<span style="color:white">0.802767678</span>,0.123818304]</span>  <span style="color:orange">In today's society people don't understand what all this pollution is doing to our world and animals.</br></br>I feel that maybe if we got all the kids in school to participate in this then would could actually make a huge difference,</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.110233226,<span style="color:white">0.80517708</span>,0.0845896768]</span>  <span style="color:orange">and maybe kids would spend more time helping and less time getting introuble.</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0688478771999999,<span style="color:white">0.8028046520000001</span>,0.1283474487999999]</span>  <span style="color:orange">If these kids would realize what our planet will look like in ten years i think they would actually want to help. soon gas will go up a lot when we get about twenty, and things will change a lot if people keep being careless and littering.</br></br>I would personally rather be helping save our community then be watching cartoons in the morning. I think most kids these days are spoiled so they see community service as ell why should i have to do it,</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.175600276,<span style="color:white">0.690867652</span>,0.1335320788]</span>  <span style="color:orange">well there are plenty of good reasons. One to save the earth from being turned into a waste land, and knowing that you could help by doing something for your community feels great</span> <span style="color:red">[Claim,Adequate/0.0523359914,<span style="color:white">0.7443379</span>,0.2033261112]</span> . <span style="color:orange">The quote i live by when it comes to littering is, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. Those three words aren't hard to do. I think you should enforce this rule and make everyone help because, what is so bad about recycling aluminum cans and paper. Today people waste way to much paper, and use way more water then what is needed.</span> <span style="color:red">[Evidence,Adequate/0.1871677747999999,<span style="color:white">0.733934668</span>,0.0788975518]</span> </br></br><span style="color:orange">So turn off the sink when you brush your teeth, and instead of an hour long shower you really only need five. If kids helped a little bit more with this kind of stuff, maybe they would learn a word i like to use which is, Respect. Respect for the environment and anything else they might have. We could even start a recycling club at our school so kids could join in. I think all kids need to help out and we should require kids to help out.</span> <span style="color:red">[Concluding Statement,Adequate/0.098407902,<span style="color:white">0.69768906</span>,0.2039030346]</span> </br></br>sincerely,</br></br>STUDENT_NAME
